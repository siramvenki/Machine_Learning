1,1,ESSAY WRITINGQ1.Essay-1:1.Helping the people if we are in high position is very great. My favourite movie is Srimanthudu. In this movie some of the staff of hero’s company invites him and his family for the celebrations of Sri Rama Navami but hero’s father refuses to go to their celebrations because he arranged another party at his home. Hero alone goes to the celebration and attend the celebrations of their staff and wins their heart. In this movie hero takes all the responsibilities of his village and develops his home town without any help from the government and not expecting anything from the people. So I liked the movie. In this movie the screenplay and taking is very good. In this film he shows the character of hero in a different way i.e. his eagerness to develop his home town.2.The second movie I like is Despicable Me. It is an animated movie. In this movie he shows a very different technology. In this movie the hero wants to be a great villain by stealing anything great. At first the Pyramid is being stolen by another villain. Then hero will get disappointed and plans to steal the Moon. In the process of stealing the moon he came across three little girls and adopt them. These girls turns the hero from a great villain to a great father. He meet the girls when he want to steal a thing from the villain. In this movie the thing I liked the most is the minions who are employees in the hero’s secret lab.Q2.Essay-1:Travelling helps to come closer to who we really are. So I love travelling. The places I like to go are the hill stations. I like to go to Ladakh which is situated in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The place is surrounded by the mountain ranges and valleys. The weather over there is very cool and pleasant. The place has the Baltistan valleys and the entire upper Indus valley and many more are present in Ladakh range. In Ladakh region different types of people live. Some are the Muslims and some are Buddhists .The culture in that region is very different. Many festivals are celebrated over there. The main festival is Hemis festival which is celebrated in the month of June to commemorate the birth of Guru Padmasambhava. The music is also very different. The music instruments include surna and dhaman. On the day of festival they sing and dance and enjoys the festival together. The things I like in Ladakh are the rock carving the hills mountains and valleys and the vegetation. In this place they melt the snow and construct long channels cutting the granite mountains and gravel slopes. So I like to travel to Ladakh.Essay-2:Playing and studying are both important to the children to develop their personality. If children focusses only on studying then they will not get physically fit. Playing is the way to relieve stress. So it is very important. So the school should not extend the school should not extend the timings. At the small age if the children are made to study always then the children are stresses and they cannot focus on one work. Paying is essential for development because it contributes to the cognitive physical social and emotional well-being of the children. It also provides opportunity for parents to engage with their children. It also give many friends to the children. In olden days the children like to play. Now-a-days the children are addicted to the electronic gadgets due to which the children are mentally disturbed. Their min is not properly developed and are facing many problems. They are not physically fit. So due to the above reasons the school should not extend the time for studying. If they want to extend the school timings then they have to provide some time for the children to play. So that the children does not get stressed.

1,2,Writing Task-1:In the lecture we heard about the Altruism which we normally see in humans and animals. It is the opposite of selfishness. In this lecture the Meerkat is the mammal that stands as a guard when other animals are in pursuit of their prey. In this the chance for the guard Meerkat for escaping from the predator is quiet easy but for the other animals it is very hard. They are in the danger position. If we consider the humans if anyone donates a kidney to the other person who is a relative of that particular person or a stranger. Then he is appreciated by the family and the society. But in the case of Meerkats one Meerkat can easily escape from the predator by running in the burrow but the other animals who are in search of their prey are in the danger position. The author opposes this in the lecture .The animals also sacrifice their food and also their life for the sake of the other animal or a group. So one should develop Altruism so that they will be appreciated by the society. So the Meerkats are a good example for Altruism. Writing Task-2:Now-a-days many children are seeking independence from their parents and some want to live with their parents. If the children are staying away from their parents and living independently many problems occur sometimes. If we live with our parents we can live happily and we can help our family. These days people are giving importance to the money but not the relationships. The people are not close to one another. For example let us take a student who lives independently. If he is given lots and lots of money then he will get addicted to some bad habits and sometimes he might use the money for the wrong purpose. But if we people live with our parents their is no chance for them to get addicted to a bad habit. It depends on the mindset of the person and also the circumstances he face daily. The situations around them will change their mindset. Some people want to live independently. If they live independently they can study well and makes it easy for them to achieve their goal. If we observe outside many people are studying or doing the jobs lonely living away from their parents. The people should be given individuality so that they can focus on their goals. But living with the parents will help one to develop good qualities and also a good behaviour. These days people are lacking the qualities of good. So the young adults should live with their parents only. The parents should not restrict the children to a certain things because they will become rude and they get habituated to certain things. One should understand the situation and behave accordingly.

1,6,Writing Task-1The lecture is about the Professors advantages and disadvantages of appearing in the T.V. It is helpful for the public to know about the newly developed concepts and equipment. By giving the lectures in the television professors have some advantages and disadvantages. The professor appear in the television as guests to some shows and they appear inn television for explaining the research work they had done and in many ways. The advantages are that they can share the knowledge with many people. It gives honor to the professor and also the university in which he works also get a good name. By giving seminars in the television they get reputation in academics and also among his colleagues. The university gets a positive publicity and reputed in that locality or area. The disadvantages by giving seminars or lectures in the television is that they has a lot of wastage of time for preparing the lecture reharsing the lecture travelling and delay in the start of the program. It any professor continuously give the lectures in television will not be available for the students in the university which brings bad name for him in the university. Given lectures in the television helps many people who has eager to know about new things but the professor should be available for the university also. So the professor should give lecture in the television but not all the time. Writing Task-2“Young people enjoy more than the older people do.”Young people enjoy more than the old people is the correct statement because they have the time and energy in that stage but old people don’t have as much as the young people. Generally in the college days the young people in groups will go to the recreation places ad also visit many sightseeing places along with their friends. Young people have the habit of enjoying free time with the friends and family whereas the old people don’t have the energy and tendency of their mind towards the enjoyment. As the old people work harder daily so in the free times they want to take rest instead of enjoying. For example let us consider the college students who were studying engineering has vacations in their academics. In this vacation time some students group together and make a plan and go to the hill stations like Kulu Manali Araku Ladakh and many other places. The older people get less number of holidays in which they will stay back at home with their family and play with their children and by taking rest. There are also some situations where old people enjoy more than the young people. For example if we consider a group of people who are friends for many years will form a group and organize an event for the vacations and holidays they get. They form a Syndicate and they conduct meetings and they will discuss about an event and then organise the event.If we consider in general young people only enjoy more than the old people because of their schedule and friends. Old people enjoys less because of their work stress and the little free time they get to enjoy. Only some of the exceptional old people enjoy more than the young people. So as per the view of mine young people enjoy more than the old do.

10,5,Professors are not mostly appears on Television. But showing themselves on tv have its own advantages and disadvantages sometimes.Professors come to television shows to share their knowledge to all the people who may not attend the high reputed universities. Their research which is done for many years can be shared with all the people.By doing this there are advantages for TV networks professors and also the public.For professors who appears on the screen their ideas will be shared with public who can get many appreciations for their work. And also get good reputation for themselves.For universities which there professors work for also get benefited by this to get good reputation and a positive feel about the university for having such good professors.But the disadvantages of showing on TV can also be like waste of a lot of important time which can be used for their research instead.And it is also known that professors who show themselves on screen are not invited to important meeting. As they share everything to public and also sometimes do not get money for their research. So showing upon TV have advantages and disadvantages of its own.
10,6,Altruism is a type of behavior in which an animal sacrifices its own interest for another animal or group of animals. Altruism is something to different to selfishness; where we can see them in Meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa.These animals guard the group while the other animals are busy keeping fed themselves they give a cry alarm to the group to indicate the danger of the predictors on them. This takes them to grave danger and lets them starve.It can also be seen in humans as they donate their food and clothes to other people who require it and also donate blood and body organs who requires them.But as per the lecture it is said that Meerkats make it more danger to the groups by guarding to the predictors as their cry allures predictors easily and the guarding meerkat also make other groups react with their cries.And as humans get little much of reward for their donations like name and fame which wouldn’t be of any materialistic use
100,1,Altruism is one the behaviour in animals and humans. behaviour of Altruism results in sacrifying the need to group around humans and animals so that they feel comfortable and satisfied by helping.in todays Altruism in humans have become rare because of selfishness and competency world. the freedom for the people is dying because of lack of altruism in people. Not all animals have behaviour like altruism because of one type of species that has sacrificed food and life to help others that happened in africa. some may have that nature but most of the times they won't .dogs sacrifice their life to help one who feeds it with food but it doesn't heps the other dog.the behaviour of altruism depends up on the types of animal species and the humans up on their nature and locality in which there are living. to summarize the topic i believe that one can get gain after his sacrificeyoung adults usually wants to have independence from their parents in some state and also love to live with their parents.younger adults are more intelligent and make things faster than they are before because of they come across various types of environments. I think its better to live their families because the parents give birth to a child and they look over them better than any other by giving their love to their child they think that their child is good and smart than any other and they dream over their child's future by giving effective needs to them. there is one example to support this reason is my childhood friend who was born in middle-class family and he is very intelligent. their parents work hard to run the family.he was interested in higher studies and their parents helped him for his studies regardless of their their position. now he is job holder in top mnc company and made his parents happy too.so that if we live with our families than we can achieve any goal regardless of our position where we stand by with love with our families.I conclude that we should help our parents and should live with them for whole life because they helps us from our childhood and takes care of us and they achieve nothing by helping us. so we should understand the point and try to be with our family as long as we live.
100,10,Writing Task-1The passage is talking about the benefits of the appearance of professors on television and the lecture opposes the appearance of professors on television.Now a day’s some professors are giving their ideas on television to get reputation for their university publicity but the time is wasted to travel to the studio and sitting in front of cameras. If the spends that time for their university students they would be benefitted.Professor giving a lecture on television or sharing their ideas may increase the knowledge for the people who watch it but it doesn’t meet the standards of the lecturer. Some professors share their ideas about current affairs history or movies but it doesn’t help the people who watch it but it can be done by the media persons in a efficient manner and it also diminishes the name of the university of the professor who works in. rather than giving such ideas on television if the works on this experiments or solving the doubts to their students may help him for his career.Because of the above reasons it may seem disadvantage for the professors appearing on television and it would bring negative impression for the professor or his/her university.Writing Task-2I agree with the statement “Young people enjoy life more than old people do” but the enjoyment may differ by their age and the responsibilities that they have.Young people enjoy their life by studying and achieving more knowledge about the science or the outside culture. Education is the key to achieve to achieve success and enjoyment because one can earn respect by achieving knowledge in specific field. For instance my friend achyuth is the best example for this. He is working as software engineer in google. He used to work hard in studies from his childhood. He used to solve the problems in an online website and he used to enjoy by it. this was seen by google company and recruited him as software engineer. So he is enjoying his life in way that cannot be measured. This is the one of the instance where is support having knowledge in young life can make life happy. Another instance is one of my friend named sindhuja National badminton player. She used to do lot of practice from her childhood to achieve her goal in badminton. she plays for the telangana state in india. She used to enjoy by playing as shehas no tensions and responsibilities at young age. She achieved the award as best National badminton player of the year 2015.We can achieve whatever we want and can enjoy our life only at our young age. As we get older our responsibilities increases and if we are not in good position it is very bad to bear that situation. So I completely agree with the statement that “Young people enjoy life more than old people do” by considering above reasons and instances as examples.

102,1,Altruism is a type of behaviour in which an animal that sacrifices their eating habits to another animal or for the particular group of animals in the group with their own interest.Altrusim is the opposite of selfishness. Every individual that performing altruism doesn’t gain anything.Example of altruism is: they are abounding to both humans and animals according to passage but whereas according to the lecture they are bound to themselves (animals and humans). A new topic arises called eating habits such as sharing food habits donation of blood and the body organs to the strangers and to the family members so that they think that if they behave in a altruistic way it will be benefited to another members in the same way as sacrificing their eating habits for the sake of another. Many species such as animals and humans are willing to share food habits or even their life for the benefits other members in the or for the assistance of the other members in the group and therefore it is fact. The meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa often cited as an example. In groups of meerkats every individual acts as a sentinel standing guard and looking out for predators while other animals are hunting for their food or eat the food that they have obtained every day. If the sentinel meerkat sees a predator such as predator such as a hawk approaching the group it gives an alarms cry altering the meerkats to run and seek shelter. By standing guard it will not get anything and it will grow itself into danger. After issuing an alarm it has to feel alone and it has to take risk to a predator. So animals should work together in a group to overcome these risks when the danger arrives from other side of the group and also from the outside of the group. So the altruistic behaviour helps you to survival of the other members in the group. In my opinion I will give preference to the young adults who are staying with their parents because if we stay with our parents they will give strength to us in case of any unbearable situation whereas if we get a freedom we will be misuse with them and many people are committing suicides for some reasons like due to the torture done by the educational institutions due to love failure due to the misuse of cell phones in the younger age because when the children ask parents to buy a cell phone we should restrict them because they don’t know how to use them and to operate them.Many people are committing suicides for different different reasons .For example we nirbhaya death created the serious issue where their parents and government fought for them for years together for the sake of solution due to the attack of the nirbhaya by the terrorists. In some movies also there will be an example that would bring awareness to the people.In other case if we will live with our parents this will not happen and this kind of issues will not appear.

If it is mixed with sport or other cultural activities it will be more beneficial to student life sport practices and cultural activities are used to build the self-confidence and it improves the confidence in child life. Finally School life should be more friendly and stress-free life so I completely disagree with the School Board."

AmulyaTOFEL TASK-1 WRITINGProfessors are normally found in university classrooms libraries doing research and lecturing to their students rather than on television but now a day most of them are appearing on television as a guest to news bulletins.Everyone thinks that professor is recognized or reputed if he/she appears on television but the fact explained in the video is that they are more disadvantages rather than advantages. Lecture as summarized few points as professors won’t have sufficient time to learn new things or technologies in their related fields and most important thing is that they are wasting their valuable time by fixing to camera angle and for do doing their rehearsal. rather than they can spend more on reading books doing research.But according to the reading passage they stated that professors will be reputed when they appear on the television not only professor even college will be benefited. Professors will be benefited because by doing so they acquire reputations as authorities in their academic fields among a much wider campus consider if a professor publishes views in an academic journal only scholars will learn or view it but when he appears in electronic media thousands I people will aware of the narrow academic community become aware of the professor’s idea Not only professor is reputed even college gets benefited for example when a professor appears on T.v viewers can know how well the college is reputed and how things are going to be done in that particular if a college has expert professors that improves the reputation of the college in addition to that college will get more donations for the university and more potential students.
11,12,ALTRUISMAltruism is a special kind of behavior which exists only in mammals and animals they scarifies their own interest for the other group of animal and the lecture part they also stated that it's nothing will be helpful to them. Firstly the passage stated that they never found this type of the survey regarding meerkat ever been done before they got to know that it sacrifies it's own life for some other group of animals or group of animals. Meerkat is the only type of mammal that dwells itself in the burrows of grassland areas and they also act as sentinel guard and looking out for predators while other hunt for food or eat food they have obtained and best quality in the animal is it's gives a alarm cry alerting the other meerkats to run and seek shelter it might be starving for a long time and after that it issues an alarm it has to flee alone so this altruistic behavior helps other group of members of the meerkat's group .Lecture stated that they never found this type of behavior in the ever been done research towards meerkat this animals they will starve for other group of members and it's makes some sort of alarm so that they can know what it wants to communicate and they also stated that humans tend to hide the things what they have and wont share with ours where as meerkat's share everything even their life for other group of animals they if sentinel predator such as hawk is approaching the group it gives a specified alarm which can be listened by a specified group of animals and they can find the food and run to save their life where as the meerkat which gave an alarm has to talk alone and need to starve for food until the predators go the lecture also stated an example that in case of humans if any of the friend or family member has suffering from the kidney problem we won't give up our own one kidney to them by even we have a option to survive the life without kidney but in case of Meerkat's they just give up their life for sake of other mammals or animals I conclude that Meerkat's set a perfect example for the unselfishness they even share their food they shelter and most importantly their lives for other animals .This kind of animals set a great impact in the social life .

12,1,TASK1 Writing based on Reading and Listening Altruism illustrates about how animals sacrifice their own interest for the sake of another group of animals. It is a antonym of selfishness and they gain nothing for themselves says altruism.Altruism is different for different species .In case of humans it gains in return something but for animals it varies. Getting a reward or thanks is not possible for animals. So they do much but get nothing .The best example of animals altruism is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa which is called as meerkats . They individual acts as a senitel standing guard and looking for prey so one among them will be standing and protecting them from predators while others take their food .There is a risk in this where predators can eat meerkats but have to stand to protect others. In case of humans this is not possible.TASK2 Writing Based on Knowledge and ExperienceToday World is running on the basis of Technology . One hand it is improving randomly and other hand has a disaster as well.My opinion is not to leave their hometown in any situation because residence is the only place which we live ourselves with enough independence. It is also based on situation why we have to leave our hometown. Education is the main reason to leave their home and go and study somewhere else in the world. This is a critical situation where some have independent and many have home sick.Leaving their own place and going makes many changes and challenges in life. If any problem arises it is better that we have a family around us. Living independently is possible in our families also. The society is developing and young adults are given wings to fly by their parents . But living somewhere else in world have to make many adjustments and have lot of pain.It also matters in health issues where we should have someone to take care of us. We can’t express our feelings and we don’t have any one to support.Freedom gives many choices and learn new things one can gain knowledge independently .This should also have a limit where everyone could have their family along with them .Parents doesn’t know what actually happening to their children but have to manage everything. Young adults has to know the money value so they should have a lovely environment in their family.Giving independence is not to cut their wings to fly but have to create a golden prison with love. Anyway there will be a situation like to work and to study leave home and have to settle somewhere around the globe in that we have to adjust our self with tears but nothing. So have to be blessed to live in home.

12,7,TASK1Altruism is a type of behaviour in which animal sacrifices its own interest for another animal or the group of the animals and it doesnot expect from the other.Altruism are the both among human and other mammals.Altrusm is unselfish which share food with the strangers to the donation of body organs.Many other species sacrifices their food even their lifetime and meerkat is the one among them.Meerkats acts as the sentinel and standing guard and they looking for the predectors.it has the flee alone which even might take risk to predictorMeerkats tyipically eat before the standing guardMeekats are most likely to escape and it issues the alarm.The conclusion is altrusic are sentinel behaviour helps to ensure the survival of others in meerket groupTASK2In my opinion young adults want independence from their parents and some prefer to live with their families for the longer time both would be their with the some or other people.Now-a-days most of the people mostly young adults prefer to be independent to be freedom because today youth are devoloping faster it is required to everyone to be self dependent and knowledgeble too otherwise it is difficult to withstand in this competitive world .for these the thing required is to be respectful obedient which can only develop if young adults are with their parents.if the adults want to live independent rather than becoming talented they become notorious because at the deveolping stages it is required for an adult to live under observation of their parents.And even parents should give their children freedom whatever they wanted to do. I conclude by saying thatits better young adults to live with thier families rather than being independent from their parents.
13,1,AltruismAltruism is one of the behaviours found in animals and also in human. It is an act of Samaritan as they sacrifice their own interest for others. But accord to speaker it's likely the other way and she also supported them through few research reports. As stated in the example of Meerkats that one of them stands as guard and helps other hunt food and eat food. But according to speaker the meerkat eats before standing guard. It is easy for the guard meerkat to run quickly in burrow after alarm cry and save its life while other are still in danger. On the other hand we come across the example of human donating organs would receive nothing. However it's an act of helping others and it should be done with zero expectation. People who receive organs or any other help would definitely show gratitude to the donor. Independent lifeEvery person in youth feel very energetic and strong to be independent. So that they can lead their live without any dependency or restrictions. They feel it as the freedom to live. However there are few people who live with their parents as they believe that parents support helps them land in good deeds. The choice of living individually helps a person much better than a person being dependent. The person has the space to understand oneself and tries to improve. There will be no more family tensions which adds for the peace of mind. One can concentrate in his/her work and try to master it.In case of an individually living person he/she can spend most of the time of his/her choice while it is shared choices among the dependent persons so as to satisfy others in the family. Being independent helps to learn cooking cleaning and also most of the household work as we do it on our own and improve our competencies. According to resent researches it is stated that the people who live independently are more likely to survive for longer duration when compared to the other people. The mental stability of the person is very strong and they can easily take critical decisions.In most of the places in the west people who just turn 15 are likely to live their parents and lead their own life. As the modern world is emerging in all aspects its one interest to improve and it can be done only through the independent life style. Every individual has his/her own goals and ambitions which can be easily achieved once they concur the personal inner world. Persons with the independent nature are more likely to survive for a longer time

13,6,Writing Task_1 Professors are the most respectable people in the society. These are the people who are bring fame to a country. However these days the professors are into television programs which would effect their life.It can be in the form where one professor getting reputation among other professors resulting in celebrity status. Through which he/she is branded as entertainment professor. Most of the time when professors go to a TV shows they generally waste their time spending hours on preparing content and focusing on camera. This contradicts the idea of professors getting fame and followed by their universities. Finally professors waste their time by getting into TV shows.Students can't approach the professors as they will be busy in the TV shows. Generally the TV channels doesn't require the actual in depth knowledge of the subject they are just considered with the title of the program so as to attract the general public. Thereby resulting zero knowledge with the viewers. It rather contradicts the views of professors through their work in research and journal writings. Writing Task_2 Young people enjoy life more than old people do Life is full of experiences. In ones phase of life from younger age to old age every individuals enjoys. However in most of the cases the people who are young are considered to be more enjoying.As the young people have much time to spend in leisure they engage themselves in many fun or entertaining activities. Youth is like a brand new bike it runs very fast as we raise our zeal and as the years pass the bike turns to slow down. Anyone in the world has to agree to the point that “Most of the knowledge is acquired in their young age”. The youngsters explore the world by traveling visiting new places and when it comes to the old people they don't have much time to explore as they will be occupied with household responsibilities and also their physical body will not support as they are aged. The old need to take care of their children or grand children. On the other hand the youngsters can manage themselves and they are likely to move apart from one place to another and enjoy life in their choice. More of the explorations and invention are done by the people at their younger age. For instance the founders Flipkart Facebook Watsapp Snapdeal Telegram are of very young age. Although there are few people in the world who are old and enjoyed their life like Dr. Abdul Kalam. They stay still as role models for the youngsters portraying their life as an example of enjoyable life. Whether it is young or old life is all about enjoying and moving on. Time passes but never the will to do something.

Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?Well if I could get a chance to spend some time I would definitely visit my grandmother’s house. I have always loved my grandmother’s house because it made me feel safe and warm.My grandmother’s house is my favourite place which I would love to visit throughout my life. I have spent the most beautiful days of my life over there. Since the days I was born to the girl in twenties I always had bundles of memories over there. I always had never ending friends in my grandparents. They were my best companions with whom I played chit-chatted fighted and lots more. I still enjoy those scooter rides with my grandpa who would be fulfilling even my craziest wish. I still remember those unstopping demands of the samosas in the evening and my grandma doing it for me. We always had someone or the other visiting their home and they would be treating everyone with lovable gestures. I always experienced the love and care in their every word and action. They always treated me as if I am a princess. I enjoyed spending my long days over there and the surroundings over there are greenery where we would watering our plants and enjoy doing that. It is completely a different world experience where I had learnt real life experiences.Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer.Generally children know how to learn in more ways than parents know how to teach them. I think implementing the longer day school is not a bad factor but it should not affect the sport practices. Well of course the students need to be better prepared for high education by spending more time but it should not affect the sport practices because every field has its own importance. The sports is totally physical practices and exercises which gives strength removes laziness and gives a refreshment and relaxation for the mind. Whereas spending more time totally on studies and even after implementing the longer school day students can’t be focused totally in studies they need some refreshment in their minds.So I can say that implementing longer school day not to be stopped but the school management should give equal importance to sport practices by managing timings.

15,5,TASK-1 WRITING BASED ON READING AND WRITINGGenerally Professors have a lot of knowledge because of their experiences and also basically found in the colleges and universities.But now a days professors are appearing on televisions as guests in order to share their knowledge and latest news that are going around the world. But the lecture in the audio states that they do appear in the televisions for the money sake and which is also a time waste process.Here the lecture states that the professors do show their interest in appearing on televisions in order to improve their reputation in this type of academic fields and also for the name sake. They also entertain the people without providing the proper knowledge which leads to a time waste process. But not all the professors do the same there are some people who shares the ideas about the latest events so that people become aware of their knowledge and to professors ideas.Finally to sum up people gains the knowledge and ideas from the professors and the lecturer states that professors do an entertainment process and also improved reputation in turn leads to some donations to him and also for the universities too. TASK-2 YOUNG PEOPLE ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN THE OLD PEOPLE Young people enjoy life more than the old people because young people are very much passionate and energy are good enough to enjoy their life. Firstly the main thing is old people are responsible for their family members in order to run it. Because they do care their children life’s and the future and also they need to earn money to have a good future by completing their work in their offices or simply by attending the duties. They prefer to spend the time with family members. According to my opinion the young people mainly “youth” will have more energy to do anything and also they show their interest by enjoying their life by spending with friends like to have parties watching movies and all the day with fun. Additionally we can say that young people don’t have the all the responsibilities like old people whatever they do. Now the technology also makes the young like social Medias which attracts them also which gives the entertainment too but whereas old people don’t show all these interests in their life. Moreover old people enjoy their life by fulfilling the wishes of their children and the family members. This is what they (old people) want actually as they grew old day by day. So this the way where old people enjoy their life with the family members.

There are many series of Twilight like The Twilight Saga The New Moon The Ecllipse Breaking Dawn where all are about the same story divided into various parts. This interesting movie also have novels which appears to be even more interesting when we read them. Bill Condon the director of the film is very much talented and it feels good to watch such kind of creative and different movies.MOVIE TITLE: CHAK DE! INDIA.WHY: Chak de! India is a inspirational movie which was released in the year 2007. This movie was directed by  and Rob Miller and produced by Aditya Chopra. This movie explores about the amount of respect for our Country Love for sports and the patriotism people have in their hearts. It is all about the our National Game “Hockey” the women’s National Hockey Team. The Lead role is played by  as Kabir Khanwho was the former caption of men’s hockey team. After some disturbance in the game Khan was blamed for that and was expelled from the team. He starts training and stands as a coach for the  Indian national women's hockey team to prove his love for the country and to get back his respect. The movie is very much interesting which explains about the players different kinds of behaviours put together and at the end everybody becomes one for our country. The way the director showed the movie causes tension for the audience about the game. The climax really created goosebumps. Finallyit finishes off with the happy ending as India Won the WorldCup.QUESTION 2:The Vacation Spot I would wish to go is Ooty which is also called as Ootacamund. It is a hill station which is located in the Nilgiri hills. It is famous for its climate. The pleasant nature and the cold breeze which flashes your face in the morning is really awesome.When you close your eyes take in the cool breeze and enjoy the nature which seems to be like heaven on the earth. It feels good to be there. There are many tourist places and the view points in Ooty to get a different and lovely experience. The feel which you get when you are heading to the peak of the hill is really exiting. The places to be covered nearby are Coimbatore Avalanchi lake which is the best view point where the lake flow is between two mountains. People mostly go there to enjoy the view point and to take photographs. The other place which is worth watching is Pykara waterfalls which is another beautiful place to visit and enjoy the beauty of the nature. A place named Doddabetta is the highest peak in the Nilgiri’s. It is one of the famous View point situated near Ooty. The pine forest is an other place where there are many pine trees which are arranged in an orderly matter which grabs the attention of the viewers. The gardens and the parks there are fantastic.

The botanical gardens where different types of plants flowers trees are there. There is also a Chocolate factory. Ooty is also famous for Home made chocolates. The cottages and the lodges places are also attractive. The Historical Buildings there are very interesting. God has made the nature in such a way that every pinch of it is really beautiful to accept. QUESTION 3:I am of the opinion that the school days should not be longer. For any human being body exercise is mandatory. Especially for children it should be made compulsory to do things outside the house like playing sports cycling having some free space relieving from the studies. These kind of activities makes the child’s brain fresh and relaxed. I feel studying from morning to evening is actually enough for a child if he concentrates. There is no need for any extra time sacrifising his hobbies and activities. If there are longer school days students get stressed out which will again effect their performance. So managing the work in the school hours is the task of the management and responsibility of the student and the parent to do extra hardwork at home but not by prolonging the school hours.So the school hours should not be changed or prolonged and we should give time for children’s activities as well.

16,14,TASK-1The following lecture and the passage through’s light on the different opinion when professors teach in the colleges and on television.The lecture talks about the professors who give television shows about the lecture to improve knowledge for people watching TV doesn’t show professionalism. Professors should be in the college teaching students rather than on the studios giving lectures in the television. He says that this kind of act doesn’t showcase the seriousness of the professor. -Firstly Being on television will be more of an entertainment program rather than educating people. Due to this some professors may not be invited to the important conferences or meetings. They also cannot make money to do their research. If education is to be done then college or the universities are the best place to gain knowledge. Professors should be available for the students to teach or to clarify their doubts. -Secondly Time management. Time which is very important for a professor should spend time on education students in the universities by directly interacting with them. The time spent for the journey to the studio what to present getting ready to look good on television the shooting process etc eats away the time which can be used to solve students problems or doing research.So finally who benefits. Not the audience or the students. The TV reporters does not need the pure lecture. This would be devition of the professor who can spend time at the research or at the university.The passage talks about the benefits of the professor being on television. Professors are normally found in the universities but sometimes they attend for the guest lectures on the television giving expert ideas or commentary. There will be a great benefit to the professors as well as the university.Due to this the professors acquire a wide range of reputation and popularity which is not that effective on campus. They will be widely known for their knowledge.They told about the difeerence that if a professor writes a journal about his lectre only a limited people will read and get to learn from it. where as if he presents a show on televion then many people can watch and there is a scope for many people to gain knowledge from his research.This is not only advantageous for the lecturers but also the university gains a huge amount of reputation.It will lead to positive publicity of the university.The improved reputation of the university will automatically lead to high donations.The other advantage is that the public will get to know things as most of the people will not have contact with the university professors.But this people will get to know the taste of knowledge the professor have and many new things.
16,15,This passage explains about the unselfishness acts of the creatures.The given passage and the related video explains us about the Altruism which is a type of behavior in which the animals sacrifices its of interest and some times even their lives for the other animals or the other group. The individuals performing the act does not get anything for themselves. Altruism is the opposite to selfishness.This topic can be explained by taking few examples.The examples for this Altruism may be a human or a mammal. A human unselfish act states that they can share their food and even donate their body parts to others or family members. This is the unselfish behavior of the human. In the same way there are many species who sacrifices anything for their group of members. Meerkat is one among them. Meerkat is a mammal that dwells a burrow in the grasslands area of Africa. In this group every individual acts as a sentinel stand guard etc. they look for the predators which attack while the other eat their food or hunt for food. As soon as they sense for any kind of danger they give a alarm to the others by giving a alarm cry so that all the group gets into their burrow for safety.By doing this it gains nothing. In fact it gets into more danger.So the altruistic sentinel behavior helps ensure the survival of other members of the meerkat group.Being with family is totally different from being independent. There are many advantages and even flaws in both the cases. I support young adults should stay with their families to understand relationships. It is their time to feel responsible. They should take up responsibilities be a backbone to their families. Staying with the families directly impacts the behaviours or the habits of the young people. They will get to know some moral ethics. They will get to know the behavior. They will get to know the responsibilities. How to make relations and how to maintain it effectively. Independence doesn’t mean they should be left free to do anything they want. People should be there to guide us and help us. In the same manner we should learn to take decisions. we should learn to live life on our own. Individuality is not about leaving your family and staying alone. Individuality is about taking decisions learning new things. Family is the place where you can be yourself. The young mindset will be in such a way that they will not like people guiding them telling them something suggesting them. It is a stage where they feel they know everything. they can do anything. They can achieve anything.but the main thing todays generation to understand is to know the importance of their families. Yes you achieve anything even you don’t stay with your family but you will not get the support love care from anyother source that our families give us.Accordingly the parents also should support their children. Give freedom to them. Encourage them to get their goals. allow them to get some memories from their young age.by doing this the parent children relationship is going to be strong and bonded effectively.

16,6,It was 23rd January 2016 the time was 9:00 pm. The climate was beautiful with the cold summer breeze. After a heavy dinner at our college mess me along with my friends sat under the banyan tree which was at the college canteen enjoying the weather and gossiping. After chit chatting for about 2 hours all my friends left saying they had some important work to do. Me and my friend Jasmin stayed there as we were not feeling sleepy. We had a good time sharing our college memories. Then Jasmin told “Let us leave now It is almost 12:00and we should go to bed.” Then we mounted towards our hostel and our room was in the 3rd floor room no:434. We reached our room. The clock struck 12:00 and I opened the door. To my surprise the whole room was decorated wonderfully with the balloons colourful papers and there was a cake placed at the centre of the room written “HBD to our Drama Queen”. Before I could stop my excitement looking at the things all my friends came out shouting “Happy Birthday”. It was really awesome feeling. I didn’t expect this at all because I never told them that it was my birthday today. The night went on very well partying shouting dancing singing etc. It was really an awesome night and everything was going on in a pleasant way but suddenly there was a call from one of my friend who was not at the hostel. I picked it up and it was Akhila. She wished me and gave a message. All of a sudden everyone’s party mood vanished in that second and started worrying. It was our term results out. Everybody ran to their laptops rushing to open the results page. As usual the server was down as many of them were accessing at the same time. This result was really important as it was the last year and our grades were very much dependent on that result. Then slowly the page got opened and we were relieved that every one passed with flying colours and the party mode was again on. We all reached our goals and everyone were happy. It was really the most wonderful and unforgettable night in my college life.

17,12,WRITINGROLE OF PROFESSORSThe professors are important for the carrier of the student. Professors are seen in colleges universities in teaching and research. Those professors are always interacting with the people about the subject and the interested areas. Professor not only teaches the class but also he made the students to think in a particular area. The research they are doing on a particular subject can give the clear idea about the subject they are dealing.In the audio they said they are many disadvantages to be clearly speaking they are no disadvantages. The point they discussed first disadvantage as it is not good to give lectures in the T.V. It is very beneficial to the students who are in the backward communities. They are not allowed their children to the schools but the children has interest in the studies. At this situation we can say that the teachings of the professors in the T.V. was useful.The second disadvantage they mentioned that it kills the professor time. For this we can say that the professor who are really interested in the teaching can say his lectures to the all the students in the world. If the professor had a clear idea about the topic then he can teach well to all the students clearly in the T.V. By this if the parents of their children are also interested to learn what their children are studying this gives them clear idea and good knowledge about the topic and the studies of their children.The third disadvantage they mentioned was the students are not serious. The students who are interested in the studies and there is no scope to them for going out and study it is the best way to learn many things. Those students are really serious about their studies than the students who are in the college.The conclusion of the topic is professors are expected to take classes in the television. Because many of them are now-a-days watching the television and learn many things. We can gain more knowledge.TASK-2WRITINGAccording to my opinion the young people enjoy their lives than old people because the young people has strength to go out and see many places to gain the knowledge and also for entertainment. The young people have fresh ideas and they have strength to do anything whatever they want. Because of the strength they can do anything. The old people doesn’t have strength but they think wisely than young people. The young people has strength to work but the old people can’t.The old people have a clear idea about certain situations which are going to happen in our life. But the young people follow their ideas they don’t think about the further situations about that particular decision. The young people enjoy their life more than the old people. They go where ever they want to go. They have their own parties weekends etc. The old people are very important to the younger generation because the young people are busy in their works.

17,8,TASK-1Unselfish acts among the humans range from sharing of food with strangers to donation of organs to the family members and even to strangers. Such acts are altruistic in that they benefit another yet provide little rewards to the one performing the act. The meerkat individual acts as a standing guard and looking out for predators while the others hunt for food or eat food they have obtained. If the sentinel meerkat sees a predator such as hawk approaching the group it gives an alarm cry alerting the other meerkats to run and seek shelter. By standing guard the sential meerkat gains nothing it goes without food while others eat and it places itself in grave danger. After it issues an alarm it has to flee alone which might make it more risk to a predator since animals in group are often able to work together to fend off a predator. So the altruistic sentinal behavior helps ensure the survival of other members of the meerkat's group. Alturism means a animal sacrifices its own interest for that of other animals or group of animals.TASK-2My opinion is to adults has to live with their parents because until now we are under the control of our parents. For each and everything we are going to depend on our parents. We don’t know how to think and take the decisions properly. If a problem arises adult cannot their decisions properly like our parents because our parents had more experience and they know how to handle the situations and solutions to the problems. At certain age we don’t know how to solve a problem in the right way. As we think we know everything but we don’t know anything when the problems arises. For example if there is a situation that some financial matters arises in the family. The adults cannot take the decisions properly because they don’t have a alround idea about the problem and they don’t know how to handle the situations arising by that problem. Parents provide us the right way and they mobilise us to take decisions at right time in that instance. Generally when any problem arises we can’t decisions properly but our parents can handle them easily. They make us to move in a right way. Parents are the one who are going to make us learn the things to the real life incidents. Generally if we observe in some houses if any discussion is going on parents used to ask the opinions of their children. This is because they are going to analyse the ideology and thinking capability of their children. If they thought that they are not in the correct way of thinking they will the situations and they guide us to think and take decisions in all the situations. When we are with our parents we can learn many things by observing them. We are having a idea of tackle the situations and we can gain more knowledge from them.Atlast our parents are the path makers for us to have beautiful life for us. They are the persons who support us in every walk of life. I love my parents a lot and I learn many things from them. I am so happy that I am with my parents from childhood and had a chance to gain knowledge and practice them in my real life. Adults have to live with their parents and learn many things which we think that we know but actually we don’t know.
17,9,Why should managers and software engineers pay attention to the costs involved in software development documentation? Ans: Managers and software engineers have to pay attention on the cost because every time when we are going to develop a new software we shouldn’t have much cost. We should have to develop the new version of the existing software or when we are going to design a software we have a maintain a minimum cost. So every user can use the software with in less cost. What are the types of documents that may be required during the development process of software? Ans: Process of software requires two types of documentation. They are: a) Process Documentation b) Product DocumentationThese two are important because one says about the installation process and the other says about the requirements needed for the development of software.What type of documents goes into process documentation? Ans: Process Documentation involves many types of documentation likePlans estimates and schedules ReportsStandardsWorking Papers and Memos and electronic mail messagesWhy does process documentation become outdated frequently? Ans: It become outdated because the test cases are written at the development time. Plans are drawn weekly monthly basis. The data and the decisions are not changed in the regular times for the development. It became harder for the change of the data and the modification in the decisions.What is the role of working papers in software development? Ans: They record the ideas and thoughts of the engineers working on the project versions of the product documentation and describes the implementation of the product strategies and set the problems. They used to record the decisions of the developers and they are useful for the other people who are newly joined in that particular project.
18,1,If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?“It’s better to see something once than to hear about it a hundred times.” This is a Russian proverb which says that how travelling is important in one’s life. Not only have to see a place but travelling makes a lot of difference in our daily hectic and stressful life. People say live with no excuses and travel with no regrets. That is why I always choose a place to go on vacation which helps me to forget my stress and experience a new excitement in me. What is that place you ask? It is Theme Park Malaysia. And why do I want to go there? Read on to find out! The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer.According to a famous English proverb - “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy!” By implementing a longer school day we would be effectively condemning the children to the same fate as Jack. Sports are an integral part of a child’s development. And academic performance isn’t the only measure of success. I oppose the implementation of a longer school day by cutting into the sport practices. My reasoning for doing so is outlined below.
18,10,We fail at making good conversations because with or without our knowledge we have more than one of the following habits. The seven deadly sins of speaking.Gossip.Judging.Negativity.Complaining.Excuses.Exaggeration.Dogmatism.Don’t:Gossip about people behind their back.Judge a person.Show negativity in talk. This would put down the zeal of any discussion.Complaining would only cost us the listener’s concentration. Excuses aren’t very helping as well.Exaggerating can sometimes be annoying. Dogmatism should be avoided for a peaceful discussion.To be able to be a good speaker follow the foundations.There are four powerful foundations helps in speaking like: H-HonestyA-AuthenticityI-Integrity and L-LoveHonesty: Not absolute but honesty that projects a good image of us onto the listener. Authenticity: Be true to yourself. Stand on your own truth.Integrity: have and show strong moral principles. Warm up really makes the difference in important discussions or talks.No engine works fine without warm-up. So perform vocal exercises before any important talks.

18,3,Task 1: Writing Based on Reading and ListeningTitle: Professors on TV news programs Professors are normally found in university classrooms offices and libraries doing research and lecturing to their students. They also appear as guests on television news programs giving expert commentary on the latest events in the world. In some aspects these television appearances are of great benefit to the professors universities and audience too. But there is another side of coin as usual where there are oppositions to this point. Professors benefit from appearing on television because by doing so they acquire reputations as authorities in their academic fields among a much audience than they have on campus. But it was opposed as most of the professors appear as guests have no good knowledge on research fields and those kind of professors will not be invited to important seminars on research. Professors who are completely involved in research or lecturing students have no leisure time. These kind of TV programs kills professor’s time in all aspects. So who does benefit then? Even audience are not much benefited because professors can’t teach academic concepts on TV .If he tries to do so TV network operators will not agree as they need only highlighting latest concepts rather than important topics.Young people enjoy life more than older people doPeople of different perspectives enjoy in different ways. They have their own world of happiness where one may go into that world at young age and other may go at old age. But young people have strength to conquer the whole world. This point may support the statement “Young people enjoy life more than older people do”. Let us discuss some points which support and oppose the given statement. According to me People are categorised in four ways based on the way they think regarding life. They are 1. People who give much importance to achieve goals and dreams.2. People who give much importance to money.3. People who give much importance to lead life in normal and peaceful way.4. People who doesn’t give importance to anything in their life. In the first case people may enjoy in achieving their childhood dreams and goals. So these people will have their enjoyment in young age and old age too. But people who strived through hurdles many years may enjoy at his old age recollecting his/her success stories. In the second case people will only think about money. They may think money can only give the happiness but they ruin all their young age in earning money and they also ruin their old age in thinking about how to invest money earned. So these people will not get satisfied at any point of their time. In the third case people may enjoy with their family and friends and lead a peaceful life .This kind of people enjoys in young age and old age too. In the fourth case people will have no goals and dreams and do not think about anything and will not take anything serious. They just enjoy with what they have at that moment but it is volatile.Some people will face many problems in childhood and may settle in good position in their young age those kind of people will enjoy old age.I conclude this topic with my opinion that I disagree with the question that one cannot say Young people enjoy more than old people because it depends upon one’s perspective and interest.
18,4,Altruism is a type of behavior which we can see in both among humans and other mammals.Recent studies revealed some interesting points about meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa . Meerkats are the best example for altruism in animals. When meerkat groups are out in search of food a sentinel meerkat (one of the meerkats) will stand as a guard and look out for predators while others hunt for food.When a predator like hawk approaches the group sentinel will give an alarm cry and run into a burrow.The other groups will be aware of predator so that they will defend themselves.Likewise some people will be altruistic .They can either share their food with others or even share their bodyparts with relatives or strangers also.Those kind of people do not need any rewards or awards for their altruism.The non-materialistic awards make them feel hapy.Some adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible . Other young adults prefer to live with their parents.I strongly believe in second situation and I am one of the young adults who prefer to live with their parents. parents are the ones who made us what we are now . we have to show minimum courtesy to them being their children.The courtesy can be shown not by giving moneygifting expensive items but it is only by living with them infront of them.This situation also helps in brightening moral values among children at their early ages. Children come to know about all aspects in a diversified way when they live with their grandparents. There are many more reasons which gives strength to the second situation. Now a days most of the students are acquiring higher studies and getting settled at the age of 25 on average. This shows that upto their most of life they are struggling for children to settle in their life but after once we settled we want to live them again and come to our career.This is what a relationship is based on.There should an equal balance between both the parents and children.

Then Onwards The Janatha Garage became a Heaven for the people who are in Trouble.I like the helping nature of the people .

It was Awesome.The overall theme of the Movie is to help the needy people and protect the Environment.Movie 2: Life is BeautifulIntroduction:Six youngsters live and grow up together in the same neighbourhood. Together they enjoy the many flavours life has to offer and step into adulthood which is full of aspirations and responsibilities.I found the Responsibilities of Elder Son in the Home. I am inspired with that theme. It is collection of multiple Stories and it is all about relationships among them.“On March 4 1849 John Smith was born to Anna Bradcock Smith and James Smith. Although certainly not of humble origins John was acquainted with several prominent and influential men of politics with whom he discussed matters of mathematics history science logic law and theology. Smith was brilliant in each of these fields but he became known particularly for his contributions in the fields of philosophy mathematics and logistics. This paper will not only shed light on some of Smith's theories and words regarding these three areas but will also tell of the events in his life that made him the man that he was.”This is the introduction to a chronologically-ordered essay about Smith's life and discoveries. As such the choice to begin with his date of birth is a good one. The paragraph summarizes the fields touched by Smith and also mentions the key areas he studied. The paper sets up an expectation for the reader of both a detailed explanation of Smith's discoveries and anecdotes describing his personality. The sentence structure is grammatically sound and flows well. Set 2:“Stereotypes abound in today's society. People seem to have an innate compulsion to categorise others into various groups and then to apply rigid and limited descriptions to these groups. There are therefore amongst others stereotypical nationalities and races; stereotypical sexes and sexual orientations and stereotypical classes. And one place where these stereotypes often thrive is in the mass media particularly in the tabloid press and popular television such as in situation comedy. Some for example Hick (1996) claim that this is a harmless phenomenon whereas commentators such as Ealham (1998) point to the possible dangers of obsessive stereotyping in the media. This essay will examine what sociological evidence there is for the process of stereotyping in the mass media and will then go on to analyse the reasons for its occurrence. The final part of the essay will ask how far society's attitudes are in fact shaped by this portrayal of the various kinds of stereotypes.”This is a very good introduction. It's about the right length; gives a little relevant background and context indicating that the writer has thought about what a stereotype is in its broadest interpretation; makes some initial references to sources; and finally focuses precisely on the question showing the reader that it has been fully understood and that it will be answered. Note that the wording of the final part of the introduction is very close to that of the question. If the essay follows in the same vein it should get an excellent mark.

2,1,Professors appearing on tv is not a good sign for students. Instead of being on the TV professors can meet the students and clear the doubts of the students at the University and spend there time wisely. Professor appearing on TV may send bad vibes to the fellow professors as they may think that the professor isn’t serious about his work.On TV it is hard to explain all the concepts and moreover the TV channels just telecasts the main points in the video only for one or half an hour. There is no in-depth material during the TV sessions for the students that they can follow. The professor has to come up with the points and ideas that he has to speak during his appearance on the TV and this would waste a lot of time for the professor. In my perspective young people enjoy life more than older people because older people tend to lose the excitement and the anxiety as they become old. In case of younger people they are always full of excitement and anxiety. For example when we are in our 20s and 30s we tend to spend most of our time with our friends by watching movies or by visiting new places but for older people its hard to find time to meet people as they are always busy. In case of older people there are lot of responsibilities that are on them . Older people are prone to health problems. In the case of younger people they are less prone to health problems. Younger people have a lot of ideas compared to the older people.

2,8,Altruism is basically seen in animals and also human beings. The meerkat’s portray the behaviour of altruism which basically means sacrificing its own interest for the sake of others. The meerkats dwells in borrows. In each group one meerkat takes the responsibility of guarding the other meerkats from predators. If there is a predator incoming the guarding meerkat gives an alarm cry alerting the other meerkats. By doing so the guarding meerkat puts its life in danger. If it finds a borrow it hides in the borrow. Sometimes the alarm cry alert might attract other predators and it might cause problems to the group.Sometimes the alarm call may be considered as a get together call and it might draw the meerkats towards predator. So it is very important that the meerkats should always be attentive. Apart from animals human beings also portray the behaviour of Altruism. For example people donate food to the poor and some people donate organs to family members or strangers. By doing so they don’t get any money or rewards they usually do it for self-worth and self-satisfaction. Parents play an important role in every individuals life. It helps to shape our lives in future. Starting from the childhood parents show us the right path. Staying with parents and helping them when we are most needed will provide us self satisfaction and happiness to our heart. Parents provide unconditional love in every stage in our lives.Once we get settled in our life’s we should never forget about our parents because they are the one of the main reasons for our success and for our growth.

2,9,"Essay 1 The Dark Knight opens with one of the best bank robbery scenes in film history and is one craziest way to introduce Heath Ledger's version of the Joker.  The music (if you can call it that the high pitched hum) is unsettling as you watch the bank crew kill each other off one by one and as the Joker leaps into the back of the bus leaving a string attached to the gas canister behind him.  One of the most brilliantly shot edited paced and scripted (being able to find humour in the grittiest of moments ""Where did you learn to count?"") bank robbery scenes ever.Essay 2I have been a die hard fan of Game of Thrones and if I get an opportunity to go on a vacation I would like to visit the shooting spots of the Game of Thrones. Most of the shooting takes place in Belfast studio and also in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has some lovely open spaces to enjoy for free from Country Parks to a spectacular coastlines. Ireland is well-known for its superb scenery for its vibrant cities and of course it’s quaint and picturesque villages and towns. We have hundreds of ancient castles and monasteries that I would love exploring and a vibrant culture that I would surely enjoy. Essay 3The school days shouldn’t be longer in my perspective because many student’s might be putting in 12 hours a day when we consider transportation and other school activities. Longer school days could make children to loose quality family time. Extending the school hours could also probably harm student motivation and stamina. Studies show that students have interrupted sleep due to school related stress. The longer day could lead to tiredness burned-out and could also effect children’s performance or force them to abandon their after-school activities which are also important for social development and growth.

20,4,The lecture is about the opposite of the selfishness of the animals or the individuals that is termed as the altruism or the altruistic acts. The individuals or animals performing the altruistic acts gain nothing for themselves. Both humans and mammals may be taken as the examples for altruism. In humans the altruism acts that is the unselfish acts range from sharing of food with strangers to the donations of body organs to family members and even to strangers.In the lecture an example was taken for the better understanding of the topic. They took the example of the animal meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in the grassland areas of Africa. In the group of meerkats an individual acts as a sentinel standing guard and looking out for predators while the other meerkats hunt for food or eat food they have obtained. In the lecture it is also mentioned that the meerkat that stands as a guard will be easily able to escape as it stands just before a burrow. the meerkats that go into the jungle for food has the most danger. The sentinel helps ensure the survival of other members of the meerkats group.Some adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible . Other young adults prefer to live with their parents.I strongly believe in second situation and I am one of the young adults who prefer to live with their parents. parents are the ones who made us what we are now . we have to show minimum courtesy to them being their children .The courtesy can be shown not by giving money gifting expensive items but it is only by living with them in front of them.This situation also helps in brightening moral values among children at their early ages. Children come to know about all aspects in a diversified way when they live with their grandparents. There are many more reasons which gives strength to the second situation. Now a days most of the students are acquiring higher studies and getting settled at the age of 25 on average. This shows that up to their most of life they are struggling for children to settle in their life but after once we settled we want to live them again and come to our career. This is what a relationship is based on. There should an equal balance between both the parents and children.

20,7,Professors are usually found in university classrooms offices or libraries. But if we watch television the professors are seen there also. So the topic is the appearances of professors on televisions. According to the passage the appearances of the professors on television have certain advantage. But according to the speaker there are disadvantages too.Let us first consider the advantages. Firstly the professors benefit from appearing on television because they earn reputations as authorities in their fields. For example if the professor publishes an academic journal only the scholars will know about it. But if the professors comes on television the chances are that more people might know him. Secondly the universities also benefit from the professor’s appearance. Because when people see a faculty from a university on the television they think the university is reputed and the funds for the college might increase.Now there are certain disadvantages too. The first disadvantage is that if a professor comes on television we cannot say that the professor is knowledgeable. Because usually the professors with limited work experience in the work and research think of television as medium to gain fame and raise funds for their research. Second for the television appearance there might be a lot of time waste for the professor. Because to appear properly a certain amount of time is needed for the make-up. And to present well time is needed for rehearsing. The time for journey is to be counted too.So the appearances of professors on television have advantages along with some disadvantages. Not all the professors that come on television are knowledgeable. At the same time some professors might be from really reputed universitiesYoung people enjoy life more than older people do. This is a phrase we come across very often. Irrespective of the country / state we might have heard this phrase from at least one person.I according to my personal opinion I disagree with the statement. Yes young people might enjoy. But we cannot say that young people enjoy more than older people do. According to me people enjoy not depending on the age but the company in which they are. Yes company is a very important thing. If you have a good company you can enjoy anywhere and anytime irrespective of the age.Let me explain the above statements with examples. So let us take example of older people first. We see many older people going to the parties movies together along with their friends. Sometimes we come across certain families that go for summer tours and seasonal tours etc. with their families. So we may say older people along with the young people but not more or less than them. At the same time we see some older people not going anywhere and sticking to their houses. Now let us take the example of young people. We mostly find young people hanging out with their friends active and nearly everywhere. Young people have friends at various levels like school college and office. But at the same time we see some young generation sticking to their computers and not involving in any kind of social activities.I conclude by here that we find all types of people in all the age groups. So irrespective of the age groups people enjoy according to the situations and depending on their company..

21,4,Task1:writing based on reading and listening?Altruism is a type of behaviour in which an animal sacrificies its own interests for that of an another animal or a group .altruism is the opposite of selfishness for some benifits.some species do not have any benefits but they still sacrifice them for the others.for example the meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows ingrassland areas of africa .in group of meerkatsan individual acts as a sentinel as a standing guard when the groupof meerkats are feedingthe sentinel have its food first and acts as a sentinel for their group when an thesentinel meerkat sees the predator such as a hawk and gives an alaram to the rest of the meerkatsand it will hide in to burrows to save itself then after listening to the alaram the remaining meerkats willalert and they will go in to their burrows to save their life. the sentinel meerkat saves its life also savestheir groups lifeit is not expecting any thing from the group of meerkats this shows the complete alturismfor example among humans range from sharing of food with strangers to the donation of organs to the family members in humans some may expect benifits for sharing of food to donating the organs and some may not expect any benefits the sharing of food with strangers and expecting benefits will not happen but some humans who donate their organs to their family members or to the strangers may expect something back for benefits. Task2:writing based on knowledge and experincesome young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible.other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time.which of these situations do you think is better?use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.In present generation many of young adults want to live independently from their parents because they want freedom from them so many of young adults are moving out from their parents as they start earning but this is not correct According to me parents are most importaant in our lives we should not live parents and home town because from the childhood what ever you want they provide everything for you like good education foodshelterclothes and spending money on our enjoyments .Every thing whatever we want in the time of childhood they provide all requirements to us.so in their old age we have to look after our parents as they looked after us in childhood.we should not live our parents in their old age because we have to look after them and stand beside them as their strength.Parents are very much important for us it is better to live like joint families rather than living alone we have very much benefits by living with parents and our family members if we get any problem they are ready to help us in otherside if we live alone and away from them if we get any problem nobody are there to after us so according to my knowledge the best thing is living with parents is the better than living alone by leaving them.

21,8,Rewriting Writing a PassageWhen I was going through some career websites this week I found your company takes in people this summer. Which seemed very good can you please mail me back on the application process.
21,9,Task-1Summarize the points made in lecture being sure to explain how they oppose specific points made in the reading passageIn my point of view professors are well educated and teaches to the others. Professors are well known to educate anybody not only in universities and colleges but also outside.According to me some students want to join in top universities where they can gain more knowledge from the professors of that university but if they fail to get admission in that university they can learn from the television when they appear as guests on television news programs.When the professors appears on the television news programs then there is a benefit to everyone not only the students of that university.There is no time waste to the professor by appearing on the television news channel because they will give lectures on the television when they are free but not attending the colleges or classes.By giving lectures on the television the professors gets good name and as well as the university and most of the students and employees will to join in that university to learn new more things.In my point of view universities get name and fame through professors who are teaching in that university so by giving lectures in television the people can know well about the professors and the university.Finally I conclude that the professors appearing in the television news channels will be help to everyone and gets name and fame to that professors and the university. Task-2Young people enjoy life more than older people do?According to me young people will enjoy more than the old people because young people have more strength than the old people.Young people can go anywhere and can do anything but old people can’t because they don’t have enough strength and lack of interest.As people becoming old and old they lose there strength and also they can’t enjoy as the young.Young people can go anywhere and in any type of climatic conditions but the old people can’t and they can’t survive in some climatic conditions as young people can survive.For example a young man can travel anywhere can go to the pubs and also many places where the old people can’t .As people becoming older and older the way of thinking and the attitude will be changed because they don’t have that much strength.The older people will give many suggestions to the young people because as they experienced everything before.Mostly we find most of the young people are working in industries companies and different work places because young people can work and more than the old people because in less time the young people work more than the old people.Finally I’m concluding that the young people will enjoy more than the old as young are more active anywhere and had good strength in any type of situation and the climatic conditions.
22,1,EW1-TO-S2Instructions: In the following paragraph transitions have been removed. Write an appropriate transition from the list given below in each of the blanks in the paragraph.: Major ideas: first second for one thing for another thing finally Examples: for example for instance Additional examples: in addition also additionally moreover Conclusions: all in all on the whole as one can see Sources for College Writing Students can draw on a variety of sources to help them with writing assignments. First they can draw on personal experiences. For example for an assignment about communication skills a writer might think about the way he or she communicates through conversations with others while at work or at home. Additionally a writer might look at ways he or she communicates with others electronically via email or texting or Facebook. Students might also find examples of written communication skills by looking at skills they’ve learned for previous writing assignments. Second student writers can look for ideas from other people’s experiences. For instance writers can interview other students or even family members. In addition a writer may have heard others talk about this topic maybe in class. Another source would be television shows on the topic of communication. Moreover college writers may find that they need to do some research to complete an assignment. In addition lots of experts have written articles or books on the topic of communication skills. For one thing a search of “communication skills” on the internet might provide useful information; For another thing reference librarians can help students find research materials in special collections or databases. Finally college writers need to be able to draw on a combination of personal experience observations of others and research materials to develop their written assignments.

This also increases your ability in society. The one who speaks about others in front of you will also gossip you in front of others.Judging: The second thing to remember is don’t judge yourself as great and judge the argument. Look whether the others point is also true. Some people believe themselves as great and judge themselves.Negativity: In our society than good we see the negotiation is increasing day-by-day as we don’t look after the positive end. So complaining on little things and stopping your work at effective places where you work shouldn’t be done instead please to be rejected.Excuses: We know some things happen without our permission and should be left at soft corner.

22,6,TASK: 1Altruism means one animal or human sacrifices for their own group. It means without any selfishness and there own interest which gives benefit for others.In many of the species willing to sacrifices their food and help in other ways without having benefit. For example like Meerkat is a mammal one of the species of grass lands area of Africa in which one from the meerkat group acts as an Sentinel which guards the one of the meerkat group by standing alone and looking for the predators who are approaching the group and others search for the food or eat they obtained food. If one of the predator approaches the team it gives an alarm cry so that others can understand there is a danger. In this case when there is danger it gives an alarm and get into there borrows. The others who are searching food are now in danger because due to this signal the predator can find actual place of the meerkat and other thing is that due to this signal the meerkat of the other group gets confused and this signal from his own sentinel and try to save themselves. This sentinel doesn’t have food but still it can save from the predator and it is benefit for the meerkat standing as guard.In case of human beings without selfishness their share their food and others with friends as well as strangers. For example a person can donate his own kidney to their relative and unknown person it is like sacrifice that person donating kidney saving the life of other person but that person has a benefit is that person gets name and money for his sacrifice so person gets benefit for the sacrifice. TASK: 2A Person should achieve something should work independently. Young adults are the persons who can work hard can live there life independently without helps from their family. This Kind of people likes to live individually. So they think to have freedom from parents and live life in a different way as they like it. Young adults have the good maturity level can think on their take decisions own and they have enough confidence to do anything. In my point of view a person who can live individually can learn more about the world. Young adults can live individually without anyone’s help and can face the world and can solve any problem on their own.But In case of persons who likes to prefer to live with families and have no freedom of doing something on their own have many restrictions and follow instructions of the family persons and their suggestions create boundary around us and should live in that boundary. It creates loss of Independence to us and the young adults can’t live this type of life so they think to have independence as early as possible. As there are many advantages and there are disadvantages young adults who live individually sometimes can’t handle the situations and want some help. At that time we should build your confidence and face the situation and handle the situation is important. So handle this situations increases the confidence.
22,7,Writing Task-1In universities there are well knowledge professors who can teach well and good at subject. We can see they can share knowledge and can understand by the students. There are some professors give guest lectures in television in order to share the views about the latest things what happening in the outside world. This helps to get awareness for the students about the latest things. They are benefited of this lectures and will find new paths to get knowledgeable. This gives benefits not only for the students and also the professor because they get reputation for the guest lectures.The guest lectures give less benefits to audiences because the lecture provide by professor will be summary this will available in the internet and more benefit to the professor because professor can increase standards in the university. There is a loss for the professors because of this television lectures they are not get into some important meetings about the academic discussions. There is another lose many of them think professor just to get famous persons from this guest lectures in the television.The Universities also be benefited of this lectures by having the publicity about the university and more students will try to join the university. Students with high potential show interest to join in the university. The students in the university will suffer because professor will not be in the campus for most of the time spending time to give television lectures and students face problem to clarify the doubts the professor not be available in the campus.Writing Task-2 According to me we can enjoy at any age. Basing on the age the type of enjoyment changes. As a kid we can have one type of enjoyment playing different types of games enjoy watching cartoons in the television. Kids play indoor games and outdoor games. Youth enjoy watching different type of movies visiting to different places participating in the different competitions. The Old people pass the time by studying different type of books listening to the music and that is their style of enjoying. When compared to the Young people to the older people young people enjoy a lot. Young people enjoy their life by exploring themselves in a different way. I think young people will travel different to places finding about the new things and learning about different cultures in the new places. Tasting different types of dishes. Learning about their life style. There some who enjoy trekking. Young people are interested in learning new things and enjoy that type of learning. They are some young people gives stage shows and mostly young people will go to live performances.old people will stay at one place studying different types of books related to god or watching devotional programs. Mostly old people take rest lot of time by sleeping. Mostly old people stay at home not going outside world. Mostly they visit to temples and some devotional meetings. They are some who will enjoy at that age. Most of them prefer to have daily a routine life.So I think young people enjoy more than the old people do.
23,1,Task1Professors on TelivisionIn the lecture there are points which are exactly opposite to the points that are in the reading passage. Both lecture and passage are related to the topic whether the professors should give program in news channels on television.I will go with the lecture rather than passage because points told by women are correct. Now lets look out some important points in the lecture which are disadvantageousMost importantly lots of time will be wasted for the professor when he gives programs on television for not only interviews for also for travelling makeup.Research time will get wasted if professors give programs on television Professors can’t spend time with the students for clarifying doubts.Moreover will not benefit professors as well as they will not get enough time on doing research.College officials will think these professors are not serious and just thinking for reputation but will not do workThese professors will not get call from any important meetings.Public is also not interested much in seeing these kind of shows.News channels will only call professors because of institutions value but not seeing his own fame.These are some important points mentioned in the lecture which I feel is true when compared with passage. Passage is only summarises about advantages which is not true.*****************Task-2Young people enjoy life more than old people doYes I agree with the statement young people enjoy life more than old people because young people have more energy when compared to old in most of the cases and also as they are young they will be having less responsibilities when compared to old people young people can do whatever they want as they will have energy and time to do but for old people they can’t do any work without the help of young people as old people don’t has much energy. For the young people there will be a beautiful life with many excitement things. Young people when they are in teen age they will enjoy college life to make it a sweet memory of their life. After college when they start working again there will be many excitement things like girlfriends pubs and appreciation in office and in outside. Young age is the best age to fulfil their dreams but in the old age we will have dreams but they will not have energy. So in my opinion young people enjoy a lot when compared to old people.

23,11,"Passage on Altruism1)Altruism is a type of behaviour in which the animal sacrifices its own interest for that of other animals or group of animal2)In a recent study of science they find that meerkats eat before it starts guard with full stomach.3)As they stay near the burrow so that they can easily escape into the burrow.4)Before escaping to burrows it gives an alarm alerting the other meerkatsso that they can escape from the meerkats5)By standing guard sentinuel Meerkat gains nothing it goes without food while others eat and keeps themself in grave danger6) Altruism in humans is opposite to selfishness.7)Altruism is also amongst the humans who donates their kidneys for their family members or strangers and also did not get any appreciation EssayAccording to my opinion I prefer to live with my family members because i love my family and every shoul love one's family because they gave birth to us and when we are like children they teached us how to walk and also how to talkso we should be grateful to our parents and will not leave our parents. For example if we want to leave independantwe are suffering with fever but no one is there to help us even though we said no to our parents but our still our parents dont stop loving us that is the affection of parents .So inn my point of view i love to spend my life with my parents for along time. But there may be rare scenarios where yound adults are struggling with their parents herrasementso there may be chance of getting indpendent only on that particular scenarios but that is only a rare case as i previously said.But many young adults eventhough getting parents love and affection they are thinking that their parents are not giving independance which is wrong. Being to be independent is good but it is not life and we cant hurt our parents feelings for such silly reasons. For example for independence sake you will leave your home and go to USA for independancebut when you go you will miss your home and also if your relatives or parents are in serious condition you can't even come and meet your parents or relatives and also there is a saying in english that ""Parents are next to god"" and also parents are ""first teachers"" who will teach most important lessons like desciplinehow to speak etc. With this statements I can say that my arguments is true and i can also say that staying with my parents is the only time that i love."

I like that place because there are many site seeing and pleasant places that we can visit and enjoy. Some of the places we can visit are Borra Caves Kailasagiri temple Simhachalam temple Ramakrishna Beach Araku valley and many more attractive places. We can enjoy climatical conditions of Vizag.

Let me ask you one question why is it necessary to have a longer school days? Here is the answer. To study longer hours so that they can improve their knowledge academically. If they have a longer school days when can children play sports and when there will be the physical exercise which is equally important? So this is the reason i am not supporting longer school days. If children study longer hours in a school they can go under pressure so if they play sports for some time and then again study their mind will be relaxed and they can focus more on studies so this is the reason for not supporting longer school days

24,1,Alturism may be a type of behavior in animals.Sacrificekindness is the intended nature in Human beings.In the passage as stated that meerkats protect thier own kind as a sentinel guard.Here we cannot simply state it as a sacrifice.But coming to some of the studies show that in the mammal species meerkats though the sentinel acts the guard it guards with the full stomach. It signs the warning cry and it goes to the shelter and first protects itself. it shows the altruism by sending the attack warning signals in this process sometimes the sentinel may also get into troubleThe animals also show the altruistic behaviour in some cases. The animal species mentioned in the passage is meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa. The head of the meerkat group is called as sentinel which acts as a guard to the group and warns the group on being attacked. On the warning sign all the members of the group will seek shelter and hide themselves. In this process the sentinel may get hurted by the attacking ones.The Modern man now-a-days should know the moral beliefEthical val;ues which are base and build for the human kind.The small things we make for others will occupy big places in thier heart.The words from a person whom we dont know may inspire u But it is a responsiblity to protect our kind and it is also a priviliege. Humans also respond to the strangers and help the person in need it shows our nature and belief in morals to our own kind.Alturism It may be behavior in animals but we are humans we are made up of values morals and ethics.The essay is about the behaviour of the young adults.Now-a-days the modern adults has brought up by drastic changes. Some of the young adults want to be independent and doesn’t want to be with their parents. It is a bbig conflict between adults and parents now a days.Some of them want to live on thier own while some want to be with parents.I support a bit more to the adults who live up with thier parents.BecauseSome of the young adults want to make them prove their abilities to survive in the outer world and while some of them want a freedemed lifeof luxury. Both cause a unreinforced loss of time.The age tendency of adults think that they have the maturity to take decisions about their life and career.Where some give up rightly and while some of them a backstabbed due to thier own decisions.Adult age is the time where they are supported morallyand encoraged by some one.It can be done perfectly by only parents cause every child is kit and kin for parents. While some of the young adults want to live with their parents they want to be in their parents guidance. But thier need tothem to know the kind and nature of the society as they are going to face a hardened path. The young adults is the phase of life in which there is a scope of learning and doing things on their own. It also improves the adaptability skills of the person.Both of the situations are good but depending upon the situation they need to be aware of what to do. When the adults got the opportunity to go to outside and study they need to be aware of the situations in the outer world. They should how to be? and what to be and what not to be? Though they want to be independent if they are in close reach to their parents. They should stay with their parents as after all we live up for parents by now where our parents lived up for us upto now.

How did Randy enable others to fulfil their childhood dreams?He says to experience the conditions so that we can get what we want by experience only. We should be more dedicated in doing things.
24,14,TASK-1:SUMMARIZE OF LECTURE -1.IH201685024 B Dheeraj chowdaryIn the video it is explained how it is different from a university professor and a professor who chose TV. In video lecture it states some clear points . They are Some of the professor’s choose to entertain than the profession actually they are meant to be. The TV chosen professor’s are generally get over there for fame and position in the society .It brings the conflicts in between the professor’s because some of them with less effort and little are get into overnight fame by television.The Tv network is actually a time waste thing as it takes a lot of time to reach and shoot and it takes time to prepare our self for rehersal and to make us good looking.The TV networks are actually very commercial in nature where they are in need for academic title but not the academic knowledge.They take the advantage of professor knowledge to have a brief discussion on so called history or detailed science thing which cannot be done by a reporter.But in the passage we can see other side of the professor version who takes Tv networks as a knowledge spreading tool. The points mentioned are:These television appearance’s of professor makes a great benefit of themselves and their universities and to common public.They acquire reputations as authorities in their academic fields among a much wider audience than they have on campus.A professor can have a larger audience of his idea’s where professor importance as a scholar is enhanced. The very few people can have the contact of professor’s now people can easily reach them .The reputation of professor brings the name and fame to the university which brings more donations and applications.Television is a medium for commentary that tends to be superficial not deep or thoughtful.By professor’s on TV by contrast viewers get a taste of real expertise and insight.TASK-2:I agree with the statement for a extend that younger people will enjoy their than the older people. Because the younger people are energised and they are active participants. They are free in nature and their age tends to make them things which are more enjoyable and memorable moments for a while. Where as the older people are came out from the struggled life going through the life expectations and reality making all the wishes of their generations to come through. The younger people are free from their responsibilities and duties they are in life of freedom. The student life is the most enjoyable and memorable part of every human. It can’t be taken back and it can’t be again done by the older people as it looks weird going to school back at the age of 40.Where the older people tend to enjoy their life being with family making all their responsibilities fulfilled. They tend to enjoy their life by fulfilling their last wishes Which they never made out in their younger. See here we have contradiction the both the younger and older get the enjoyment of their life by coming out of the aspects seeing and facing the different situations of their respective ages. The older get enjoyed by seeing their younger fulfilling their dreams and wishes. For example Bringing new bicycle to his Grandchildren gives a Grandfather happy memory for lifetime. Bringing a chocolate to his younger sister makes a brother to be happy. Like that the younger generation also find their enjoyment by making their older people wishes fulfil and making them proud.For example a smaller brother getting national prize and dedicating it to his brother makes his brother to feel happy and proud A son taking his parents for a world tour. Even bringing a delicious sweet to home by a son in the evening times makes a mother happy in tears which cannot be calculated.So the younger may enjoy well but they all get older for a while and starts to enjoy as older as their once did before. Every moment and aspect of life is memorable if we learn to taste it.
24,2,MOVIE TITLE: ANNAMAYYA Why: The Annamayya is a Telugu biographical devotional movie . The film at starts by introduction of veyikuntam (place where lord venkateshwara stays) and it’s beauty. We can see the discussion in between Lord Venkateshwara swami and Laxmi devi . The lord venkateshwara deploys his sword into womb of a mother encrypting his power and blessings in it . The sword travels all over the 7 worlds and enters into the womb of lakkamamba as a divined power where the Annamachary is born with the powers of lord. As every moment and frame of introduction is framed as a wonder of devotional magic and spiritualness we can feel that in within us dreaming the same for a moment where we can forget our self where we get involved into the movie. Movie Title: NINJA ASSASSINWHY:The movie is martial arts thriller. The movie starts in a guest house of a Local mafia Leader. One of the associate of the don discusses about the lead of ruthless Ozunu clans (known as ruthless assassin’s in the world) Japanese old man in the hall frightens by just listening the name of Ozunu. The mafia leader and his associates make fun of the old man how coward he is but the old man show his left chest where it is ripped to half saying it is the result of their attack and he is saved because his heart is on the right. Suddenly the lights goes off where in the dark the ozunu clans rip off the associates of mafia leader the place is blood shed all over and suddenly the light turns out where the clans come into the light with a blood split outfit killing the mafia leader in a ruthless way by ripping him into apart and kills the old man.

Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer.A short day of better practice is better than a long day spending.I stand that school day should not be longer. The children cannot go under a concentrated pressure for a long time. It effect the children mentality bringing up unwanted pressure. The long hours in the school not only effect the children but also brings the stressful work for teachers which may cause effect on the students. The short days allow students to go participated in the different sports and arts which bring a pleasant mind to the child relieving him from all the burden .The time spent with the family is the most precious time for a child where he can catch up life time memories. The perfect schedule for teaching with better teaching techniques make the children to be a good citizen.“TODAY’S CHILDREN ARE TOMMOROW’S CITIZENS” is possible by only effortless and value based education.

24,7,It’s was a Saturday night at the farm house of Mr. Chowdary the minister for finance a famous dignitary in the country who is famously known for his charities and his mining business. The farm house was decorated with LED lights garland because it was celebration party for the success of Mr. Chowdary in the recent elections. The farmhouse is surrounded with full of guards and special security. The so called dignitaries from all over the country has been arrived. The menu and drinks served in the party shows the richness of Mr. Chowdary. Everyone was waiting for the Host. There comes Mr. Chowdary in his rolls along with his 3 sons and daughter who is named to be the princess of chowdary empire Ms. Malleshwari . Mr. Chowdary wore the blazer in snuff colour with a bow tie in black colour which was embroidered by a Jacob diamond which costs 10 million US $. At the late night after the party the security are in search of some unknown photographer. Because a death has occurred the princess was murdered but he is not the murderer. He is the one who knows the murderer is? . The photographer was finally captured at the nearby village by the security. The murderer himself came in front of the photographer with a ferocious face and wicked laugh and with a Cuban cigar in his hand and 9mm German made pistol in other hand. He said to me “You have done a great mistake you have clicked the wrong photographs may your soul rest in peace ” these are the last words that I have listened these are the last words written by the photographer. No one knows the matter of letter that was mailed to DGP office by photographer before he was killed. A case was filed against Chowdary. The case went on for 3 years and the final judgement is Dheeraj is no guilty. He walked through the court doors with a pride smile which shows his political and money power. The truth stands in between two poor souls and chowdary. A poor soul is screaming somewhere “My dad is the killer kill him kill him please kill him”. He killed me for his pride for loving a poor guy which injured his pride and poilitical career.
24,8,Two people are said to be friends if they have the similar taste feelings and response over the things.My best friend is Umesh Chandra. If my friend was asked to say about me I can say definitely that he describe me like this. Dheeraj always used to say me that I am the replica him but the difference is that I used to smile and he use his hand to avoid the problems. I used to call him “Dhiru” and he used to call me “sodhara”. We both first met in our inter college. Dheeraj looks so ferocious at first i used to talk to him very rarely. But after the days went off i understood his generosity. He is the man of ethics. He is the man discipline. He always used to say me about how to live the life how to make good relations and all. Even though he has big circle of friends he always made time for me on special occasions. When I was to Delhi he himself came with me and spent a day so that we don’t miss each other. Even he visits me frequently.The other part of him is that he is little lazy too. There is a good cook in him and great foodie too. He likes to taste new delicious foods. I still remember the day he nearly ate 14 basin ladoos at a time. He suddenly plans vacation trips and always made me a part of it. The long drive to Mumbai highway is the best memory I had. Even he makes us to hesitate by his actions. I always used complain about his ferocious nature. He simply becomes angry for silly things and small issues. We always used to stop him from becoming angry. But we all know that he is kind in nature. If anyone of us in need if we make a name who can help us is him. He is the one who i like and care most and we can expect the same from him undoubtedly. 2.To me every Monday is a boring. Because the problem is Monday comes after the Sunday where everyone enjoys and celebrates the weekend especially we used to enjoy the weekends by planning sudden trips and hangouts. But the next day on Monday we used to go college forcefully like dragging a ton weight. Me and my brother used to go by bike. He is such a bad driver he takes me to the college within 15 minutes which is not a like part of my daily routine. By 9:30 our first class of prof. Mohan starts who teaches us M-1 the nightmare of everyone in B-tech. After that we have chemistry lab where we have to prepare the new solutions of different saturations. We used to enjoy the lab a little bit when some one of us makes the wrong experiment. It goes for two hours and ends up by foul smells.Their comes the Lunch break where all our gang fellows meet in canteen having the tasteless food prepared by our canteen chef. Now it’s time to rest lab sorry the IT lab where we sleep for hours instead of coding. Here comes the final moment of the day the sports period . Yes now we all look like new luminous lights. We play volleyball daily for 1 hour and after that we take a deep long breath listening to the bell of the college which reminds us that college time is over and its time to leave.
24,9,TASK-11. Why should managers and software engineers pay attention to the costs involved in software development documentation? The software development projects generate a large amount of associated documentation. The only moderately sized systems will have documentation that fill several filing cabinets; then for large systems it may fill several rooms. A high proportion of software process costs is more and Furthermore documentation errors and consequent system failures with their associated costs and disruption increases the costs involved. Therefore managers and software engineers should pay much attention to documentation as its associated costs as to the development of the software itself.2. What are the types of documents that may be required during the development process of software?The documents associated with development process of software must contain of some requirements. They are:1. communication medium between members of the development team.2. They should provide System information for repository and to management to help them plan budget and schedule the software development process.3. Some of the documents should tell users how to use and administer the system.3. What type of documents goes into process documentation?These documents record the process of development and maintenance. Plans schedules process quality documents and organizational and project standards are process documentation. They can be categorised as 1. Plans estimates and schedules : These are documents produced by managers used to predict and to control the software process. 2. Reports: These are documents reports how resources were used during the process of development. 3. Standards: These are documents which set out how the process is to be implemented.4. Working papers Memos and electronic mail messages.4. Why does process documentation become outdated frequently? Here Plans may be drawn up on a weekly fortnightly or monthly basis. Progress will normally be reported weekly. But memos record thoughts ideas and intentions which change over by a daily basis and instant change. So it makes the process documentation outdated. process information is of little real use even it is out of date and even there is no need of preservation. But there are some process documents that can be useful.5. What is the role of working papers in software development? These are often the principal technical communication documents in a project. They record the ideas and thoughts of the engineers working on the project are interim versions of product documentation describe implementation strategies and set out problems which have been identified. They often implicitly record the rationale for design decisions.
25,1,The audio and reading paragraph are both discussing about university professors appearing on TV.Reading supports professor will be beneficial while audio contradicts it.Reading says: professors can become famous by giving TV showsContradicting Audio: That shows the professor is not serious compared to his fellow professorsReading says: universities can benefit from the showsContradicting audio: it says professor time gets wasted in various ways instead he/she can teach and meet the students for making research in the universityReading says: Public can benefit from TV lecturesContradicting audio: no one watches such TV shows at dinner time instead they like some entertainment. So there is a chance of lecture going waste.They can be compared on basis of responsibilities and energy.In my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do. Young people vigour and energy are sufficient to enjoy life more than older people do.Young people do not have much responsibility compare to older people. For example older people have responsibility to take care of their children to earn money to complete their work etc. These responsibilities make them limited to enjoy their life. whenever they (old people) try to do something to enjoy life they give their children the first choice. On the other hand young people do not have these responsibilities they are free to choose from variety of options to do for enjoying their life.Young people have more energy to do anything. In comparison older people usually suffer from some diseases by the time while try and see as much as they can do (young people).To sum up there is a huge difference between young and older people to enjoy their life. The older people can also enjoy their life according to their new age. However at some point they feel they are not able to do everything they want and in a way they feel circumscribed.

25,6,To: Subject: feedback on performance.Dear Rajesh I am vamshi dondapati we are working on the same project. I have gone through your previous performance statistics. You have some really great skills but as everyone has some areas of improvement I find some qualities you need to improve on such as presentation skills assertiveness and being team member. I have received a feedback from our previous client about you it is stating that your performance is not up to your potential and I felt the same. And next skill where you can work on is being assertive when you are stating your opinion and convincing others. Being a team member is also important apart from completing your tasks it is highly probable that your team members may think wrong about you which disturbs the team cohesion. “There is every chance of improvement so grab the chance”.

25,7,"TASK1Meerkats are considered as example for explaining altruismMeerkats stay in burrows and they are mostly from Africa.sentinels are the ones which guard them. They actually look out for predators and gives an alarm for the rest to scatter or gather.sentinels guard after eating that is before stand guardIn the lecture it is mentioned that sentinels are the first one to see the predator and escape. It is opposing the passage which says that as they give alarm they are the one who gets noticed and as they are alone they most liable to have danger from the predatorssentinels search for the near burrows and watch for the predators so they can easily escape(from the lecture which opposes the passage)eating habits are like sentinels eat before guard (which opposes the passage stating it goes out without food) TASK2""EVERY COIN HAS TWO SIDES""First considering the statement ""some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible"" .People who does not have support learn their life faster than the spoon fed ones. So the reasons behind young people want to leave their parents may be because ""lack of freedom"" ""someone wants to live their own life to learn something from it"" ""some might feel they are burden to their parents"" etc.. there could be many more reasons but everything is acceptable until they do not misuse the freedom they are given or fall into a wrong company. While on the other hand those who wants to stay with their parents may be thinking in the lines of ""maintaining relations"" and ""some stay with parents to support the family"" ""some might not want to stay alone as there will be no one who care for them etc.."" in my opinion surely people who stay with their parents or family will learn but not as much as a person who is away from their parents because he(person staying away) have to manage his income spend money wisely manage his daily schedule food etc..but he definitely misses the relationship. There will no longer be joint families and well established relationships or no persons to care for the person who is living at his own risk. Finally i think both are better as long as they develop themselves and maintain relationships."

26,1,QUESTION 1:A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie. List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them.Format:MOVIE TITLE: PREMAMWHY: I don’t want to say about the introduction scene of this movie because I like the movie climax very much because the look of the heroine “Cyndrilla” was awesome.MOVIE TITLE: “I”WHY: “I” is a Tamil language thriller movie directed by Shankar. The movie is interesting from the introduction scene onwards since the hero’s intro is quite unique. Because the look of “Chian Vikram” was different when compared to other movies.And the movie will go on with the scientific theory. QUESTION 2:1. Read the following essay prompts and write a suitable introductory paragraph for each of them using the 3 elements of introduction - hook orient readers and key terms:Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why? Freedom requires that you discover your own inner language -your own life-you own rules. Whenever I had a chance to go anywhere in the world I would definitely prepare a schedule for the world tour. The places I will visit when I can go anywhere in the world includes seven wonders in the world.Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer. According to the study the average life of children under the age 15 mostly spend their lifetime in schools. The longer school days has some advantages along with some disadvantages. But every student takes this decision in the negative way.Pro: More Time for LearningLonger school day will give teachers more time to spend with students to concentrate on the weaker areas of student. Many schools propose extending time for each session which will increase the session of each subject. this will help teachers to teach the class without rushing it.Con: More Time Doesn't Mean More Learning The teaching procedures are not working then there is no use of extending time instead they should change their teaching methodologies. Longer school day will make students bore and will lose their concentration on studies.

26,6,TASK -1 ALTRUISMThe passage explains the word called “Altruism”.Where Altruism is an act of sacrifice altruism can also be treated as an opposite word of selfishness where in the passage they have compared animals and humans and their altruistic nature In them. Here in animals the altruism was explained by comparing the unity of meerkat and they helping nature here in humans they have compared with the sharing of kidneys between the relatives or between the strangers.Here the main thing that opposes the altruism is Does the person who is showing altruism getting any recognition by the public or do they get any satisfaction by doing this to the relatives or to the strangers. Here in this passage they clearly explained how an altruistic natured person suffers from dangers by showing the example of meerkat and hawk.How it get caught by the hawk while saving the remaining meerkats.Dont think that altruism is only sharing the human physical parts sharing food and sharing things will also be treated as altruismAltruism also be called as sharing or sacrificing .there are many people who follows altruism TASK-2 Here in this the clear question is that “does leaving parents give us freedom” I support “living along with the parents will be the great situational answer”.Because many of the adults think that we don’t have freedom when we are with parents.I think parents wont restrict us when we do the right thing according to the situations and the main thing is that don’t try to escape fromthe responsibilities because every person will have some responsibilities towards the family and people wont get a better friends or well wishers than parents. Don’t treat your parents as an ATM machines because every adult should share the duties of his parent. An adult will think that leaving parents is an independence but leaving parent is “leaving yourself and your independence” .persons will get realized by themselves when they have become parent
26,7,Summarize the points made in the lecture and how they oppose the points made reading passage.There are some points in the lecture which opposes the appearance of Professors on Televisions.As mentioned in the passage Professors are normally found in universities classrooms and offices and libraries doing research and lecturing to their students. Some of the professors appear as a guests on televisions news programs They may think that it is benefit for their university and they will get reputation by appearing on televisions But spending time on televisions will waste their time which can be used for their researches or They may give a lecture to their student during that timeThere are some Disadvantages for the professors or lecturers who are appearing on televisions. They May utilise the time by spending on research.They may not be attend to the important meeting in the universitiesThey may not get money for their research.No one will be beneficial by doing this. As viewers may or may not follow the points which were said by the professors. And news channels want academic titles to improve their market but not the intellectual topics. And being on television may waste the professor time like travelling time Younger people Enjoy life than older people do.I agree with the line mentioned above because. Some of the people will think that older People will enjoy their life than younger people but in my view Younger people will enjoy life than older people as older people have responsibilities of their families like wife husband children but younger people don’t have such responsibilities and older people need to earn money for their family .And the energy levels of younger people are more when compared to older people As younger can move any to any place as they are healthy when compared to older people. Older people have different health issues compared to younger people as they can’t move from one place to another easily as Younger people and another big advantage to younger people is technology.Younger people can go with the technologies in an easy way when compared to older people. Younger will make their work easy by using the technology but older people can’t get through these Technologies easily when compared to younger generation Take an example of internet “Younger people can use the internet easily than older people” and many of the application in the internet. Younger people can go to trips or to movies easily with their friends or alone. But older people need to take the entire family for the trips and movies. Older people will think before spending the because the money may be useful for the family members but younger generation don’t have such responsibilities because he/she will get pocket money and they can use it in any way because they don’t have any responsibilities.

28,10,Task-1Professors on Television.Speaker summaraises that somethimes it is a good thing to appear on the TV but sholud figure out who are benifited by appereaing on Television.By apperaing on TV professors will get repuatation only from those fellow professors who are not a serious scholar who are there to entertain but to educate.Secondly being on TV will take lot of time for the professors.Not just the time on the TV but for the travel figuring out whay to present how to present for rehearsingalso for getting ready for the interview/show.All this time is included in professors's daily routine where the professor need to do research and teach students in that time only.At the end professors are not getting benefited in a good way rather they face big disadvantage.Even TV network doesn't require intellectual substance rather they need acedamic title.Tast 2Essay.Title-do you agree or disagre with the following statement?Young people enjoy life more then older people doYes young people enjoy a lot when compared to the older people.Since young people don't have to many responsibilities when compared to older people.Also the age of younger generation attracts them to enjoy their life rather then for study.Its an age factor the young have stronger body and more energy than the older do its not like the older people don't enjoy their life but when compared to the young people they cannot defeat them(in enjoyment).Younger generation have their own way of enjoying their life. They enjoy with the New technology which actually provides them to develop more ways to enjoy and relax. For example the Internet young people get addicted to it as it is very popular and common among them while it is not common among the older. It is hard to deny that the Internet impact people life heavily. With the available of the new technology the young have more different and colorful choices to enjoy their lifes than the older do. Also with the convenience brought by the technology the young can live their lives more easily.The young have less limitation to enjoy their life than the older do for example they can go rock-climbing which requires a lot of concentration and body strength. They can race the cars with high speed which is not too exciting to the older people who might have some cardino-vaesscular problems. In other words the younger have more opportunities to challeange limit exercises.Alsothinking with flexibility leads people more fit in their life. Older people sometimes take decisions based on experiences and principles while younger people are more creative.They take risks to accomplish their work.Thinking out of the box helps people to live a better life.I sum up with the point that young people enjoy their life more than the older people do.
28,2,Practise Test 1: WritingSummaryOften in science assumptions are made from the research and the same has been done in the meerkat’s behaviour.Meerkat is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland area of Africa. The eating habits of meerkat are quite different.In a group of meerkats an individual acts a sentinel standing like a guard and looking for predators while the others hunt for food. Sentinel gives an alarm when a predator approaches towards them .Sentinel has more chances of escaping when compared with the group as others who look for food are in more danger. Due to this sentinel often runs without food while others eat and run. The altruistic sentinel behaviour helps others in the group in saving their lives. In humans the altruistic behaviour is show cased by donating food or organs like kidneys to family members or to strangers without receiving any appreciation in return. Altruistic behaviour in humans gives non-material rewards.At last individuals performing altruistic acts gain nothing for themselves except sacrifice.Task 2:Majority of youngsters want independence from their parents while some prefer to live their families for a longer time. There is a lot of difference between living individually and staying with family.When youngsters live away from parents they need to mange everything all alone without any help but when they live along with their family there won’t be many responsibilities for them to handle.Unlike in individual life living with family generally gives a secured feeling since the surroundings are completely filled with loved ones.Staying with family and living individually has its own added advantages and disadvantages separately. Youngsters always ask for freedom and independence from responsibilities till they reach to the level of maturity. They don’t want to handle anything which creates an extra work for them but staying with family teach a lot of things starting from handling responsibilities care for each other helping etc.Individual life is like a free bird at the same time it is hand full of responsibilities and work management. The lack of affection care and love is clearly visible in this life at the same time a lot can be learned by living away from family since responsibilities come in to the picture.Family life is filled with bonding where as individual life is filled with loneliness. Youngsters face new challenges when they live away for family due to which they even gain awareness. They even learn to know how to be daring and gutsy as they need to overcome the difficulties and challenges they face in their solo life. By developing this nature it becomes an advantage for them when they travel or live alone in any part of world in any age. Still living in a family teaches the value of relationships bonding and the process of maintaining them which lacks in individual life.

This state is in the Northeastern United States and is the 27th-most extensive fourth-most populous and seventh-most densely populated U.S. state. New York is bordered by New Jersey and Pennsylvania to the south and Connecticut Massachusetts and Vermont to the east. The state has a maritime border in the Atlantic Ocean with Rhode Island east of Long Island as well as an international border with the Canadian provinces of Quebec to the north and Ontario to the west and north. The state of New York with an estimated 19.8 million residents in 2015[4] is often referred to as New York State to distinguish it from New York City the state's most populous city and its economic hub. The home of the United Nations Headquarters New York City is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world as well as the world's most economically powerful cityImportance of Sports & Games in SchoolThe importance of sports and games in school encompasses more than just the benefit of physical activity. Increases in self-esteem and mental alertness make school sports and games necessary for every school age child.

29,4,"1Altruism is considered to be an act of mere kindness or opposite to selfishness. Altruism is more commonly found in the clan of animal kinds rather than humans.According to the lecture the recent surveys show that animals which act as Sentinels of their group enjoy more facilities like eating food before the othe rmembers of the group etc.Well apparently it has been proven that sentinel guard which sees the predators first gives out an alarming cry to alert the other members of the group. This infact helps the predator to focus on the group rather than one since the alarming cry by the sentinel makes the group to either gather at a point or move away towards the safety. This gives the sentinel more chances of saving his life.Even though Sentinels are brave enough to do such risky tasks it has to be ensured that they attain the importance of their valuable deeds.Similarly when compared with the altruistic nature of humans it doesn't depend upon the amount of the work done or the importance of deed it all depends upon the unselfish nature of the society to act altruistic similar to the meerkat.""INDEPENDENCE FROM FAMILY DOESN'T MAKE YOU STRONG IT MAKES YOU FEEL NOSTALGIC""Firstly it all depends on the attitude of the people living with their parents. Eventhough we consider ourselves to be a westernising/modernising country it isn't necessary to leave the parents and leave an independent life. The culture of Nuclear families is gaining popularity in our country because of ennumerate reasons depending on the class people belong to in the society. Enthusiastic youth tend to leave their parents as young adults to pursue their passion in the form of career. But they do forget the fact that their parents always care for them.Leaving your parents as a tender youth is a complete misconception among the people living in the present society. Nevertheless there arises a question did they leave you when you were young?! Most of the cases it's absolutely 'No'. Prominent celebrities like Virat Kohli started oldage homes to ensure the protection and service of the old who are left stranded by their children.Actually staying with parents for a longer period of time makes one happy and feel secured. They get the feeling of surity while discussing personal as well as social grievances with the close ones like parents.Afterall sanity is the only thing one requires."

29,7,"Academic Title vs Intellectual KnowledgeAccording to the lecture the television networks do not want the professors appeaing as guests on their shows to educate the people watching it with indepth analysis of the priority issues.Instead they need someone who can entertain the audience with his/her witty speech. Professors who tend to appear in the television shows need to look after their students as they may waste precious time of the young minds by preparing thee content of the show rehearsing it travelling to the shows etc rather than working along with the students on research work.Well the passage shows a totally different scenario while discussing about the importance of professors attending television shows. This infact increase positivity among the people on university of the professor. The fact is today's world is a digitalised one. Henceforth it makes sense when a professor tries to teach a amasive people with ease by using television.""Experience is not what you wish for instead being happy with what you get""The above statement justifies the fact that Older people enjoy their life a lot when compared to young people. This indeed is true because the older people have many experiences in their life both good and bad which makes them wise enough to judge a situation cautiously. Young minds are more prone to emotional falls anxiety lack of experience and a few times even because of careless attitude. Young people cannot judge the situations which might occur in the near future. They love to live the life their way without any complications. In reality is it that simple to get what you wish for?! If you're young the answer always makes you feel sad. Here's why the old people are happy they're neither worried about the past nor on the tensions which may occur in the distant future."

3,3,PassageThe lecture states that Altruism in animals and humans is not completely selfless.Though the other members of the group are more benefitted due to altruism more than the human being or the animal performing the altruistic acts the animal or the human performing the act is directly or inversely benefitted due to the altruistic acts.The passage states that the meerkat is a mammal which sacrifices its food or even its life in order to protect its group from the predator.But the lecture opposes the statement by spealking out that the sentinel meerkat already has its stomach full before it gets to guard the group. Also as the sentinel meerkat guards the group positioning itself nearer to a burrow in order to escape quickly the group members are prone to get caught by the predator than the sentinel meerkat as it escapes into the burrow as soon as it alerts the group members and the group members are still scattered in the fields searching for food and eating.The passage also states that there are humans who perform altruistic acts by donating food with strangers or also donating the body organs to other strangers or their relatives. The passage specifies this as a selfless act.Wheras the lecture argues that the humans also recieve benefits from the altruistic acts. These kind of donations earn them non-materialistic rewards in the form of appreciation and many others for performing the act.The lecture concludes that the altruistic acts are not completely selfless and the one performing the altruistic acts will be benefitted in any form.EssayThe thought of independence from parents arises only when there is a lack of understanding between the young adults and parents. People with better understandings never get a thought of departing from their parents and stay independent.Nowadays the society and the work environments have a changed a lot compared to the previous generations. So many parents feel uncomfortable looking at their pupils in-front of computers all-day long. This may inject a kind of insecurity feeling in their minds that their pupils don’t care for them. This lead to disturbances between the parents and the young adults. As the mind-sets of the young adults is aggressive they prefer getting out of the environment and live on their own so that they cannot be questioned by anyone. So the concept of independence has come into picture.Whereas if the parents understand the change in the generation and adjust themselves accordingly the young adults will never see this problematic and will prefer staying with their parents. Staying with the parents is a better option compared to being independent as the independence may create gaps in the relationship between the young adults and the parents. Staying with the parents enables the young adult get out of stress due to work as spending some time with loved ones gives a great relief from the stress.Living with parents keeps the young adult conscious of what is going on with the life and will stay cautious from getting into unethical deeds and also live a decent life.Living life without parents is not a secure way of living as people face many hurdles in life without parents. They gain the strength to face such hurdles is with the help of parents and their support for their pupil’s success..Living an in dependent life doesn’t give such support to live life successfully.Hence living with parents and family keeps a person mentally and physically strong and also gives the strength to face hurdles in life and taste success.

3,9,"Soft SkillsWRITINGProfessors are normally found in University classrooms offices and libraries doing research and lecturing their students.Many of the professors are invited as guests in popular TV shows giving expert commentary on the latest events in the world. These are of great benefit to both the professors and also the universities.Professors benefit from appearing on the TV shows as they acquire reputation as authorities in their academic fields and also have much wider audience than they have in the campus.Also if a professor publishes views in an academic journal there are very few people who follow them as only the scholars go through it. But if the same views are being presented through a TV show there will be a great increase in the number of viewers and also the professor gets a better appreciation and reputation.The benefit for the universities from the professor’s appearance on TV is that they get a great positive publicity to their university which leads to more admissions in the universities and also donations from potential students.Finally the public. The public gains good knowledge from the professors giving lecture on TV's. As most of the TV viewers don’t have contacts with the university professors the TV will be a great opportunity for the viewers to learn from experts and to be exposed to the views they might never come across.Television is generally a medium for the viewers to listen to the commentary from the professors and acquire a taste of the real expertise and insight.Essay""Young people enjoy life more than older people do""Enjoyment is a state of being happy by doing something a person likes to do. Enjoyment is given the first priority in a person's life. The taste of enjoyment differs from person to person. In the state of enjoyment a person undergoes various emotions like happiness enthusiasm fun etc. Enjoyment for a person may differ depending on the neighbourhood family individuality friends relatives etc.I strongly disagree with the statement ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do.""People enjoy live in their own ways. For each age group the mode of enjoyment keeps changing.A baby enjoys sleeping all the time and playing.A kid enjoys playing with parents and going out for a ride with them.A child enjoys playing with friends.As the child grows older the bond with the friends grow stronger and always find enjoyment with the friends.So a teenager finds enjoyment hanging out with friends.As the teenager steps into youth career becomes their priority to enjoyment. So until settlement the enjoyment becomes the work.Youth finds enjoyment in their work and they enjoy their work.Once they settle most of them enjoy travelling.Once the person gets married the enjoyment lies with the spouse.After the couple give birth to a baby their world of enjoyment revolves around their baby.They play think care about their baby.Once the baby starts growing the enjoyments of the baby starts and the enjoyment of the parents lies on the happiness of their family.As they grow old and clear all their responsibilities the older people enjoy life in their own way.They play with small children give suggestions to their children out of their experience with life etc.So we cannot judge the way people enjoying their life. Every person has their own style of enjoyment."

30,4,Managers and software engineers should pay attention to software because they have to know the approximate budget of the project. So they can plan the project accordingly.The development process software includes documents like initial idea of the project prototyping the idea and design implementation of project and its results.Process documentation can be done according to the viewers. If viewers are audience we have to give them document that consists of simple flowchart. If viewers are engineers we have to give elaborate information of process including the energy flow flowchart.The process documentation becomes out-dated because most of the documentation includes flowcharts. Generally any person can understand the flowchart quickly than matter in documentation.By working papers we can understand the workflow and details about the project. It acts like project guide. It can also work as installation guide for application and it can also work as Manuals and quick reference guide.

32,1,According to the passage it is talking about the positivene how the professors are benefited when they appear on television Where as in the video the women explain it is not a good practice for a professors to appear on televisions and she was also explain how the time would be get wasted by attending those television and in the passage where the professors are benefited with televisions as they get reputation with it where as there if they are part of any university then that university would be also benefited as it also get reputation by this university also receive positive publicity from it. Where in audio she was telling that the when the professors appear on television there would be no one would get benefited but were in passage it is where the viewers get benefited when a professors comes on television .Television is the best medium were the viewers can let know different things they want to. Young people enjoy life more than older people do. It is not the matter of age where it depend on the people how they want to leave there life and were they find enjoy for there life were it is not depend on the age were there if a man of a 50 to 60 old will enjoy his life with different way as he like and were the young people enjoy life in there way but it not as if we are old there would be no enjoyment in life as time change every thing will changes in life but we can’t compare the people of young age would enjoy there or the people with old age would not enjoy there life .as it is not a matter of age it is the surrounding we make to leave enjoying le or in any other way. We can say that young people have more time and more energy so they can enjoy there way as the old people have there different things to have enjoyment. But enjoyment not depend on the age or any thing else .There is now were written that each and every young people is enjoying there life and old people are not enjoying there life .

32,11,Rewriting a passageWhen I was trolling some career websites this week I noticed your company has trotted out for an intern this summer.The position sounds rad. Can you email me back about the application process.
32,12,"Randy Paush Lecture1)Randy meant that we cannot change any situation we just have to deal with them in the right way. we have to decide how we are going to deal with that particular situation.2) The key points included:- One should never give up on their dreams and always follow their dreams  -Have fun at whatever you are doing-Respecting authority while questioning it-Help others -Never lose the child like wonder -Its always fun to do the impossible -Always show gratitude -To never give up -Loyalty should be given and taken 3)Randy talked about six of his childhood dreams:-Being in zero gravity -Playing in NFL  -Authoring an article in World Book Encyclopedia-Being Captain kirk-Winning stuffed animals -Being Disney Imagineer4) Randy meant that one doesn't need to become what they have dreamt. He never wanted to be an astronaut he just wanted to fly. So being specific regarding dreams meant one need to be very confident on what he wants from a dream.5) Brick walls are there for a reason. they are not there to keep us out but they exist to show how badly we want things. They are there to stop the people who don't want things bad enough.6) The things Randy learnt from football is that fundamentals are most important and there should be somebody who can correct you if you are doing anything wrong because if there is nobody to correct you it means they gave up on you.He also learnt the power of enthusiasm and the freedom he gained from this.7) Randy believed  if you did something when you are young and also trained for it then it becomes a part of that person. He learnt the power of enthusiasm team work perseverance hard work and a lot of aspects from football. Thats why he was very glad football was a part of his life. 8) Randy wasn't sad he that could not play in NFL but he was very much happy because while trying to accomplish that dream he learnt something more important in life. While playing football he got a lot of indirect learning (head fakes) such as team work and perseverance.9) After Randy gained some more knowledge in Virtual Reality the officials of ""World Book"" asked him to write an article on his field and thats how he accomplished the dream of writing an article for the encyclopedia. 10) The most important quality Randy learnt from the character of Captain Kirk is Leadership. From this character he learnt how to lead people by watching him.11) The message Randy has given by winning stuffed animals is that we live in a world which has digitally manipulative things yet we can convince people that we have accomplished some dreams by showing them to people.12) When he visited Disney land for the first time he was so inspired and thrilled by it. He want to a part of such a thrilling and exciting world and that inspired him to become an Imagineer.13)Wait long enough and people will surprise and impress you means that sometimes we will be really angry at people and we might be mad at them it is because we have not given them enough time to be themselves. Once we give time to people they tend to understand us more and will impress you someday because their is good in everybody.14) The way we communicate is very crucial in every way. There is a way of saying anything in two ways that is a good way and a bad way. And one has to realize that communicating in a good way is way better than being rude.15) When of Randy's students came up to him and asked that he would like to be a part of his team he realized a way to fulfill their childhood dreams by establishing a course in his university. He called that course ""Building Virtual Worlds"". This corse had 50 students in all departments that gave the students a sense of excitement of putting on a show that gave everybody to fulfill their dreams"
32,2,TASK1:According to the passage altruism is a type of behavior in which an animals scrifices with there own intrest to the other animal or a group of animals .Where in the audio altruism was discribed as it is a human or an animal done for there intrest. Where example of altruism abound is among human and other mammls.It is the unselfish acts to other humans or the other animals to words other. In the third passage it saying about different species of animals which are willing to sacrifice food or even their life to help other member of their group. Where the meerkat is a mammal that lives in Africa where in the audio file it was opsing the statement in the passage that the meerkat are the mammal. Where in the group the meerkats few of them act as the guard to help other group mates ware in the passage it it is saying that the meerkats which are guard will guard without Having Food and safe guarding other animals from other animals. Where as in video guards will have the food before and act as the guard to the other meerkats and the scream when the group are in danger.TASK2: According to me I would prefer to live with their families for a long time .yesthis days most of youngstars want to independence from their families or parents but i think it would be a wrong idea we should be independent but living with out familie and parents it would not a good idea.I belive that it is better for all concerned if young adults can continue living with their parents and families for long time First of all after becoming an adult it is best for every one to head out to embrace our independce. Although it is the most important part to earn money for coast of living .fpr instance for foods rent unilits and study to build there future ratherthsn doing part time jobs that me hamper there education. It would be most important to live with there parents as if there a only child to parents then if he left them and they want to live independent then at point of time it would be difficult for the parents at the time of there old age so the youth has to be think for a long distance so it would be best for both familie .so they can take care about there parent at surtan point of time and there are many youth adults want to just get ride of the parents after their education and want live their own life independently and it would be not a good idea .
32,3,Question 1:A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie. List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them.MOVIE TITLE: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.The movie is about four turtle brothers. They live in a tunnel hiding from people and protect the city from troubles. The introduction of the movie was so good as it started off with some brilliant action stunts. The movie shows the importance of bond among the turtle brothers and how one could face any troubles if they stay together.MOVIE TITLE: Zindagi na milegi dobara The second movie which I liked is Zindagi na milegi dobara. Which is about Friendship Love Travel  this are the things that can make anyone's life better and this film sums up everything in the best way is Zindagi na milegi dobara!  The beginning of the movie starts with 3 friends whose friendship goes through a series of changes as their responsibilities come in between And their plan to overcome all their fears with the help of a road trip they planned.Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?If I could go on vacation then it would be only one place and that is the city Rio de Janeiro which is a part of Brazil. Why:                         Rio is a pretty good city and it is surrounded by mountains and a sea it has a good view of sea and mountains. The most important thing to me is there's no other place like Rio. It is a combination of many things like Parks music jams Copacabana beach spectacular football matches high mountains and the most famous statue Christ The Redeemer.             Rio is very famous for its beaches and visitors always love the city for it. It has two amazing beaches one is Ipanema beach and the other one is Copacabana. The world's most stunning urban landscapes are found in Rio Hiking in tijuca rainforests is considered one of the best adventures and Sailing surfing rock climbing and hand gliding are also very popular.

32,8,Task-1Read the below given document. (10 mins)Write answers for the following questions in 30-50 words. (10 mins) Why should managers and software engineers pay attention to the costs involved in software development documentation? In case of any software project a large sum is invested for documentation. Be it a large project or a small one everything needs a proper documentation. if there are any documentation errors they lead to system failure and increase cost so managers and software engineers should pay attention to documentation. What are the types of documents that may be required during the development process of software? Types of documents required during development process of software: Several documents are developed for any project to give information about how the project behaves and how it works and during the development process some documents are important like -project plans: they help to understand the plans  -design specifications: these help to understand the design or structure of project -test plans: they help to understand the objectives and market for a projectWhat type of documents goes into process documentation? Types of documents for process documentation: -plans estimates schedules:  they contain all information about plans and help to estimate software process -reports: how all resources are used are given here -Standards: they help to know how project should be implemented -working papers: they give technical information about the project -memos and emails: communication between managers and engineers is providedWhy does process documentation become outdated frequently? Process documentation becomes outdated because when a company is implementing a project all plans are made every week or every month. Now this doesn't mean all ideas and thoughts will be same everyday. Changes will be made and also once a project is delivered that information becomes uselss.What is the role of working papers in software development? Working papers help to give technical information in a project. They have ideas and thoughts of engineers who work under that project. It also has details of problems found and also some design decisions

33,3,A technical report on possibilities for Renewable Energy System with Recreational Facility.THEME: Reducing the impact of CO2 on the environment by utilising engineering techniques. The report shows that complex buildings which are in commercial size are releasing carbon dioxide into the environment in different means those buildings are not built in a way of utilising the renewable energy sourcesTECHNIQUES AND DESCRIPTION:A material with Good thermal properties by selecting materials which enable low fabric heat losses. The modern way of designing buildings can be designed to utilise the solar power which is a unlimited energy for commercial purpose.Even building Regulation Fact L2 considers the solar energy as a highly recommended one because of its advantages.By the utilisation of solar energy power the gases that come out of those buildings due to thermal effect can be reduced when compared to natural heating. But this type of designing of buildings require proper plan and a low priority to the cost is given because these require a good thermal property materials are costly.And also the building materials that have been selected give high thermal mass to the structure that will give the building a high thermal capacitance and help prevent the effect of wide seasonal temperature swings by giving the building a slow thermal response.These buildings are designed with “Ventilation Factor” which explains how sizing of the heat takes place in a building. In this consideration process several building service concepts have to be considered that include Natural Ventilation Stack Ventilation Bio mass and passive building design that adds an increase in budget of the project.ADOPTED PLACES:These technologies are mostly employed in South England in the UK there main point was to create a building with good thermal properties by selecting materials which enable low fabric heat losses. The Victorians were experts in this field .They demonstrated the use of stack ventilation on a commercial scale in places like prisons and Hospitals. Similarly others have researched the use of underground air pipe arrays to form supply air ducts.So It is the intention of the report to illustrate the renewable resources utilisation like solar thermal system which operate on primary closed loop thermo syphon principle bio mass boilers ventilation techniques can be employed in designing the buildings that can reduce the release of carbon dioxide and other Greenhouse gases into the environment in one way or other. Hence by selecting proper materials that have high thermal capacitance for design and its architecture of design can reduce the release of greenhouse gases into environment.

33,6,Read the below given document. (10 mins)Write answers for the following questions in 30-50 words. (10 mins) Why should managers and software engineers pay attention to the costs involved in software development documentation? What are the types of documents that may be required during the development process of software? What type of documents goes into process documentation? Why does process documentation become outdated frequently? What is the role of working papers in software development? 1a. yes they have to pay attention to the cost involved in software development documentation. The documentation need not be so long so as to give very in depth of the product to the customer. But it should be as much as required to the customer or user. If the documentation is so long with a lot of technical stuff present which may or cannot understand by the user easily. By making such a long documentation is a is a waste of cost involved. So while making development documentation cost has to be considered so that there will be effective management of the capital for the new development.2A:The documents should provide clear detail of what a particular software do.The documentation should involve multiple columns those may contain for the expert technician service employee that should be understandable for the standards of respective department in an organistaion . Those may contain outlook of design cost estimation servicing and debugging too.3A:During the process of development the documents such as test plans and also reports of the tests that helps in understanding the product development and its maintenance and also for the further improvement of it. Those should act as an interface between the developer and the manager for the clear understanding of the product design. Examples of them are planning plans Estimates schedules reports working papers emails which shows progress.4A:the process documentation become outdated frequently because whenever there is the optimization in the complexity of usage of a product there should be again a new documentation of the developer.It is not possible to define a specific document set will make upto end. So process documentation should involve about the feedback for the test cases so that by considering the feedbacks there will be a better development of the product. Hence the process documentation will be outdated frequently. 5A:Working papers acts as a key role in development of a projectbecause the working papers involve the ideas of the engineers and also it contain the difficulties encountered in designing the project.they also give the decisions that are to be taken further.
33,7,Altruism is a that can be seen both in animals as well as in humans but in a different way. This Altruism is seen in animals mainly by meerkat which mainly will go for food .One meerkat will acts as a guard that take care of other meerkat while they are in search of food .The Meerkat which acts as a standing Guard will have a stomach full of food .not because of mainly these animals are found in Africa .By Standing guard which is also called as a sentinel gains nothing after it issues an alarm it has to flee alone which might make it danger they mainly differ that meerkat that go standing guard is said that it gains nothing in the process but before that when it is going to act as a standing Guard it had a stomach full of food .But in the passage it is explained that senitil was gained nothing But there lecture had not explained about the senitil after it issued the alarm for the other meerkat to escape from the dangers or from the predators like Hawk .in scenario the views are both different in explaining about the meerkats .essayMost of the parents in the present society want to make their children a good graduate and then they make them to go in a particular way irrespective of opinions of their children .Some students who are not mature enough about the society and the way of living will definitely have to take decisions about their career and life .In this Scenario we cannot clearly judge about the young .Some young people will follow their own dreams irrespective of their parent opinions but their success rate is vey low when compared to the adults who follow their parents advice .I came to hear about that one of my friend wants to become singer but his parents want him to become a civil servant . when their parents joined him in an institute that gives coaching for civils he did not find much interest in the subjects he tried for 2 years but he did not at least qualified in the exam .He was totally discouraged by his behavior and his parents too not happy with the results he got .their parents cannot afford much more expenditure on him so they set him free to follow his dreams that as a singer but the he lost flavor of the music so he also got rejected in some of the singing competitions by that he had gone insane which is not good for him as well as his parents. In the present era the adults are very much known about the society and the life in the society .one may have to achieve their dreams irrespective of their parents opinion they may succeed or may not but they will be happy if one will follow their own dreams .in this world people are of different minded every one has their own dreams and also everyone want to achieve their own.finally i want to say that adults become independence from their parents only after they became independent from their parents.
33,8,Young People Enjoy more life than older people do.No!! I do not agree with the above statement People who are old nowwere young before and might have enjoyed a lot when they were young.As the quote expresses “when there is a will there is a way” will suites present topic very well. Life is meant to live happily. People find the enjoyment in different aspects Some people feel their enjoyment when they take an adventures alone and some one find enjoyment when their family together will go on a vacation and spend there happily. Even the physical disabled persons can enjoy in their own means .So to which extent does the people enjoy depends on the factor “age”.Young people are usually find enthusiastic and also mostly they are free from worries and family problems They can easily do what they want like run jump diving etc.And also they do need to save money which if they earn they do not even bother about the financial issues .but this is not in the case of older people they always have to take care of their family and have to save the money for their families .As one grows older relations will become narrow and at last they always find only their family relations but where in case of adults and young people will find many friends through out their graduation .People who are old now were once young might have enjoyed a lot more than you are doing now .Not all the young people are enjoying and not all the older people are not enjoying It only depends on the maturity of the mind and finding ways of enjoying. There are many people who are old but party harder than the young people do. So I finally say that the way of enjoying will differ from person to person and nothing can stops any one enjoying in their own mean.I completely disagree with the lecture .The passage describes about the some of advantages of when a professor apperrs on T.V. Appearing on television will increase the reputation of of a professor But the lecturer was talking about disadvantages on being on TV .When a professor explains something in T.V.it reaches a lot of people who cannot afford going to big universities .And also when a professor appears in TV he will be known by most of the people thus he can gain reputation .Being in TV for a while does not lose anything students making lectures on T.V. does not make degrade anyone infact he raises the reputation of the university .When the lecturer said about the travelling time to the studio rehearsal time and make up time does not affect much about the schedule of the professor. Not all the professors will get a chance to appear on T.V.so there are some people who expect some content some content from the lecture given by the professor on the television.the lecturer says instead of appearing on television the professor can spend time with the studentsbut in my point of view the same students can also watch the lecture from the T.V.By that way they also can gain knowledge. SoIt does not matter when a university professor appears on T.V. or not.Both of them have their own advantages.
34,1,SUMMARIZATION ABOUT THE LECTURE AND THE PASSAGE1. In the passage it was clearly given that Professors and universities are benefited by appearing as guests on television but in the lecture given says that it is not good to appear on the television.2. In passage they says that appearing on television the university as well as professors get good fame but in lecture it says that it is waste of time to prepare travel and to get ready to look good on camera.3. Passage clearly explains about the benefits due to rating and donations given by viewers but lecture says that it only focuses on the brief knowledge about the topic where the professors don’t have satisfaction on their presentation.4. By presenting professors get good reputation but they are seen apart from other lectures due to which the professors were not called for the meetings and conferences. This was given in the lecture. But in passage it says that due to their presentation they get benefited and they will be known to the people all over the world.5. Knowledge can be share by presenting and the people who had doubts on particular aspects can clarify their doubts not only the university students all can get clarification on their doubts. This helps the professor as well as the management with the positive publicity.6. But the lecture says that it was waste of time where they can use their time in doing more research works and can attend students and conferences.7. Televison doesn’t need any intellectual substance it just need that show should benefit them with high ratings only .But in lecture it says that television is a medium of commentary that tends to be superficial not deep not thoughtful.8. From professors the viewers get a taste of real expertise and insight.9. But the lecture says its waste to present because it needs only historical versions not the knowledge on the subject deeply.10. FianalyI conclude by saying that passage had given all the advantages of television and lecture had given all the disavadvantages of the television.YOUNG PEOPLE ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN OLDER ONEYes I agree with the statement because we can prove that statement in our daily routine activities. Old people also have their feelings to enjoy but due to their age they restrict themselves to certain conditions but Young as they have correct age they enjoy a lot based on the situations they grow up.At Younger age only we have a chance to fulfill all our wishes and desires and that is the age we need to achieve something best in our life to enjoy or to be happy at older age also.(i.e); being independent. They have lots of enjoyments like going out with friends enjoying in parties going to the places where we find different new things to see. But in older age we cannot move to longer distances even if we have intension to go. Our Age restricts us more than our desire. So we need to enjoy and get satisfactory hearts for enjoyment in young age itself. Older people have lots of family burdens and mainly they need to take care of themselves and their family. In that age rather than enjoying their mind tends towards caring and Spiritual side. It was proved by many people that as we grow older our thoughts mainly focus on spiritual side.For example we if we see our grandparents they sacrifices everything for the sack of the family and they tend to live out of enjoyments like Young people. Their only enjoyment is to see their family happy all the time. But Young people are interested in going long drives enjoying their whole time with their friends. Their thoughts always travel along with the enjoyment only. Some people search their enjoyment in their dreams and some in enjoying with friends and some in travelling etc; So Young people search for different ways of enjoyment.So here I conclude saying the Young people enjoys their life in different ways because they have different thoughts and plans to full fill their desires but old people even though they have desires they cannot full fill them in terms of enjoyment. So Enjoy life everyday so that we need not search for the enjoyment or we don’t even need to count the days of enjoyment we had.

34,12,TASK-1Altruism is a kind of sacrifices that are made by animals and people. It is done mainly by group of animals in order provide safety to their creatures. It is an act of social boundness between them.By doing this type of activity they don’t get benefit bt still follow the principle of altruism. Own interest prevails amoung the mammals and people. The best example coming to the humans was donating the kidneys and body organs to the people who are in need of it. They may be in family relations or Strangers. This is an act of human sacrifice where people wont reward and matter about the issue going on But it is and appreciable work done by individuals. Mostly these works were not being highlighted or enlighted between individuals where it is really needed to popularize these types of works and also encourage the people who relay donate organs. In Mammals a good example has been explained many species sacrifice their food and shelter to other members of their group. They protect them from all the dangers coming over them by certain signals and they be as standing guards to protect their group. Good example was Meerkat it is an mammal present in grassland areas in Africa. It acts as a guard to protect from predator where it sounds like an alarm cry intimating their group to run away and save their lifes. They acts as guard even though their life was in danger and risk and they dont know when the danger comes and stands before them. Even though it has no food to eat it share with the group members. They work together and if danger comes infornt of them they together fight with the teamwork. So the Altruism helps the animals as well as people to survive in a group with good co-ordinations and work sharing without Selfishness among them.TASK-2Now-a-days people are tending to be independent without any relations to be maintined with the parents.I disagree with this type of behaviour adopted by the people around the world.This are resulting in many effects where people are not able to get their mistakes done back to rectify them. Independent nature doesn’t mean to be independent without the guidance of parents.It means to be self confident and self natured which can also be done with the help of parents only.We need certain guidelines for the life to be calm going and to learn some things in the life which can made our life more easy and comfortable. For example many suicides are taking place in our country because of the loneliness created by themselves without interacting and sharing things with the parents.They need a baseline till the age where they know of all the things and measures of life. Being with family enhances our relations kind heartness and many emotions can be easily tackled. They need to be independent in their carrier and their goal they want to achieve.In order to achieve those they need not leave their relations and families . Bonding never give up negative thoughts.It only gives us positive feeling and make us learn lot of things.Many people due to work stress they are enable to take care of their parents.Bt we should spend sometime with them in order maintain relations and it also relaxes us a lot.They wont create lonliness feeling when we are together. So maintaining relations and being with the loved ones make our life more happy and more positive.Never regret relations because they are only the base support Which help us in worst conditions of life.

34,2,If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?“One’s destination is never a place but new way of seeing things”. So I would like to go to Simla which is one of my favourite places in India. If I get a chance of vacation I would like to go there and have fun. It had a great history which had a principal commercial cultural and educational centres situated on hilly region of state.The city consists of more temples and churches which takes the attention of visitors in the devotional way. Most of the city had buildings in style of neo-Gothic architecture .The most attractive places over their was Rose gardens and horse riding towards the hills. Travelling itself was a thrilled experience and climate over their was to cool which make me us to feel that I was in a place where I had never been and makes my heart to feel happy at that movement. Kufri is also an attractive place It is winter spot situated 16km away from Simla.All these places make me feel to visit this place had to have great time over their.A bad day in paris is still better than a good day which we don’t like. So opt to the place only based on our own interst not on the importance of that place. So I go their because I feel like a pleasant place where I could enjoy lot with my family. The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer.“Great Recess equals to Better School Day.”I support to decrease the school hours because people are spending more and more hours in school where they are not having time to play games. School days are most joy full and fulfilled with many mysteries to resolve.If the school hours are to long children were unable to play creative games and they are missing their golden days of enjoyment with friends as well as parents because after their long journey in the school they are becoming tired and they were unable to spend time with anyone. These types of situations involve in many disadvantages like they are mentally habituated to think problems more complex and are enable to make decisions on their own. In my school days we sometimes used to play in the rains make paper boats eat ice-creams and enjoy every drop of water .But now-a-days people are missing all these kinds of fun because of heavy stress given to them by the authorities.So I think school days should be memorable to each and every child It should not be burden to any one of the children. This kind of situation can be obtained only by decreasing the school hours at least by 2 hours so that they can spend time on many of the other creative activities which enhances the creativity in children.First movie:One of my favourite movie is YAMADONGHA. The entrance scene is extremely impressive because of magician role played by Alli who is one of the great comedy Actor in south industry. He introduces Hero with stunning act of magical skit where their he make a magic of changing lion to Hero. The introduction made me to feel interesting to see the movie and there are many such scenes in the movie which made the movie liked by hundreds of audience.Second movie:movie  :vantage pointwhy : The movie begins with killing of us president while addressing a gathering  in  Spain followed by explosion at the gathering. we were shown a cop in formal clothes his girl friend with another man a tourist with camera a mother and child and an FBI agent .Later the story was retold giving importance to each character from various vantage points with series of events re-enacted from different viewpoints to get exact truth of what has actually happened followed by revealing of actual culprits behind the plot.
34,3,Sources for College Writing Students can draw on a variety of sources to help them with writing assignments. First they can draw on personal experiences. For example for an assignment about communication skills a writer might think about the way he or she communicates through conversations with others while at work or at home. In addition a writer might look at ways he or she communicates with others electronically via email or texting or Facebook. Students might also find examples of written communication skills by looking at skills they’ve learned for previous writing assignments. Second student writers can look for ideas from other people’s experiences. For instance writers can interview other students or even family members. Additionally a writer may have heard others talk about this topic maybe in class. For one thing Source would be television shows on the topic of communication. All in all college writers may find that they need to do some research to complete an assignment. On the whole lots of experts have written articles or books on the topic of communication skills. As one can see a search of “communication skills” on the internet might provide useful information; Moreover reference librarians can help students find research materials in special collections or databases. Finally college writers need to be able to draw on a combination of personal experience observations of others and research materials to develop their written assignments.

34,7,Photographer.a wedding reception.Late at night.Some had lost something.Passionate PhotographerIt’s November 9th 2016 I woke up in the early morning 6:30 AM and thought of checking my e-mail. I was sleepy and rubbing my eyes to see the responses to my post in the job portal regarding part-time job in photography. My drowsiness flushed away after seeing a reply on my post I was happy to see the message “Joy I found your professionalism in Photography and your sample Images in the blog mesmerized me. I kindly request you to capture the moments for brother’s wedding reception that which is going to happen on Dec 15th. If you are interested please let me know.” In the next few minutes i replied with my interest and confirmed my availability on that day.On December 15th I got the reminder call from Sunder regarding the event and at what time I should be there at the reception. Its 5:00 PM I reached the venue one hour prior to the event beginning to capture some random pictures of event preparation by the family members. Since the event is at their home itself I clicked many good pictures that which are natural and shows the real happiness in people’s faces. Reception had gone up to late night I had my dinner and went on my way to home.Next morning I got a call from sunder saying that some ornaments were lost and we are trying to found them out So the payment will be made later to me. After all hearing about the incident I got special interest in finding the thief and started investigating. The same day evening I went to meet sunder and asked him all the details even he felt free to share everything with me. I collected all the key points that I required to end the case. I watched all the videos and found that a person is in hurry and the persons seems himself uncomfortable moreover he is sunder’s neighbor sameer who lives in their lane.Sunder wants to conform this information and asks many people about him all gave negative feedback about him. Finally we conclude that he was the culprit. I also gave the softcopy of photos they appreciated for my amazing clicks. They also promised me that they are going to invite me for the next events that are going to happen in their family. I thanked everyone and left to my home.

35,1,PASSAGE TASK In the passageit is stated that the television appearances are of great benefit to the professors themselves as well as their university and general public.But the speaker questions of really getting benefited from it and disproves the passage statements. For the point in the passage that professors get high reputation on Tv’s as there are many people infront of tv when compared to the class room.The speaker in the lecture is refusing it by saying that the professor might lose the way of his profession like teaching in class rooms and conference halls. In passageit is stated that the public are benefitted by tv lectures and sharing knowledge by this type may increase their interest in that subject.But in the lectureshe refuses to accept by saying that tv’s are meant for entertainment and no one will be interested in watching tv after dinner. In the passageit is stated that the university gets good fame if the professor is seen in tv shows.But the speaker opposes it by saying that professor can spend the time in university about research or academics rather taking lot of time for preparing for TV shows. ESSAYTOPIC: Young people enjoy life more than other people do. I go with the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people do mainly because of less responsibilities at the younger age.Moreover they are energetic and ready take any sort of entertainment as they are well prepared for that at that age. And energy is must to enjoy the life to the extent.Older people may not feel well because they have suffer from different types of diseases at that age like back pain knee painsjoint pains.All they need is take rest at the age and take care of their childrenmoneyproperty etc. Because being old has many responsibilities when compared to children where as young people are free from responsibilities and they are free to enjoy the life. With the increase in agethe responsibilities increase and the enjoyment of the life decreases.For exampleat the younger agepeople go to schools and colleges .They meet many new people and new friends as they go on become a graduate. Till then the parents take care of their expenses and economical related thing. Later on When they move on to the job they them self need to earn money as it is not good to ask parents for money and thus doing job is must.Right there the actual responsibility of a person starts .He needs to earn money get married and then again taking care of children and cycle repeats. Once the college life or school life is done he doesnt have much time to enjoy the life as he has other responsibilities to do. In the conclusionthe enjoyment of the younger people is mainly sports and games.Which they can do better in younger age that older age.Morever as the increase in technologythe entertainment doubled as people started playing vide gameswatch videos onlinemovies etc.But the older people are not that aware of using technology and pass thei time as always by reading news paper and watching tv.
35,10,TASK 1: WRITING Altruism is an unselfish act among humans and animals.Altruism is sacrificing something for others with nothing in return.Altruism is like sharing food shelter and donating blood organs to the family numbers and expecting nothing.By the altruism the person gets nothing but a good reward of generosity and a increases the self worth and a respect in the society.we can see many animals sacrificing their food for someone and also lives in some cases.One such example is meerkat.Meerkat dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa.In a group one meerkat acts as sentinel and protects others from predators when the groups go for food. When it sees a predator it will make an alarm cry for other meerkats to get formed in group or run away to save themselves.In this try it falls in more risk than others while trying to save their lives as it is alone and is more close to the predator.Thus this behaviour of meerkat which is called as altruism is helpful for their species to get saved from the predators.Contrasting points:The animals may be not aware of the danger that are caused by the altruism.So they are opting for it.Maybe sentinel is of full stomach before acting as a standing gaurdOr maybe it has a high chance to escape from predator as it sees first TASK 2: WRITING The topic was about some young adults wanting independence from the parents and some other to live with their parents for long time. We know how the young adults are developing these days with faster pace. And we can see the world also changing so fast. There is a need of developing the self confidence adaptability for the young adults to cope up with. One need some observation and guidance when is becoming an adult and needs to be supervised by someone because he may get mislead with his own ideas and do some notorious things. So the parents must be with him in that age to guide him through the better future and better life. So being under parent supervision and living with them for a long time is an acceptable statement. There is a chance of getting attracted to bad deeds when he is alone .And his character reflects with the people in his surroundings. Living with parents make him to be more obedient and a fear for head of the family .So there is less chance of getting attracted to bad deeds. Moreover being with family gives the person strength and a feel of security as there will be some unity among family members. When he faces any difficult situation or problem there are people who can correct him or suggest him when he lives with the family. In conclusion the person may get familiar with responsibilities towards his family members which in turn make him obedient self worth and increases his self respect. And his character reflects in the society that leads to a better nation. So living with the parents for a long time is a suggestible statement.

35,2,ESSAY WRITING-1DON 2: The introduction scene of Don 2 starring Shah Rukh Khan is one of my favourite introduction scenes. At those times during the release of that movie people were very eager to watch the hero introduction from where it starts as this movie is a sequel of Don.In the scene the hero talks about the situation of the scene and the reason he is coming back again. The scene starts with ship sailing in the rivers of Africa. The hero stands there smoking a cigar with ultra stylish attitude. We’ll see the tattoo as “D” which means Don on his right hand and slowly to his eyes. That taking to show him slowly and increasing curiosity made me to like this scene.OOSARAVELLI: The Introduction scene of Oosaravelli movie is also one of my all time favourites in introduction scenes. The movie starts off on a high note with excellent introduction scene compared to the recent movies .One of the friend’s of the hero introduces about the hero to the antagonist who came to enquire about him. The way he is introduced is perfectly nailed by describing his heart as a napoleon heart and his nerves as high tension wires. Where his whole body formation is started with skeleton and the body parts forming parallel to the description. ESSAY WRITING-2 All that is gold does not glitter Not all those who wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither Deep roots are not reached by the frost.It is a poem written by J.R.R.Tolkien for his fantasy novel The Lord Of Rings. We all have a wish to travel around the world or somewhere else.For mewish will be a smaller thing as I can say it as Wander lust! I have been to many places in India but that was not enough because many places left in my checklist.One such place is kerala. Kerala is also known as “God’s Own Country”. There are many reasons to support this statement. As kerala itself is seen as a synonym of beauty. The beauty of Kerala will be seen in long roads with coconut trees on the either side and greenery. Those beautiful scenes of Munnar hill stations will refute the above poem and make us feel lost in those scenic beauty and strongly support why it is called as God’s Own Country.

36,13,Question1.The passage states that Professors would be more successful if they would appear on TV .The passage gives some examples as to why the professors would be successful.But the lecture opposes the passage stating some strong reasons behind.Firstlythe passage states that television experiences are of great benefit to the professorsbut the lecture putsdown this fact.It is told in the lecture that this is not good from a professors standpointbecause a Professor would become a part of entertainment rather than a professional.He would become a TV celebrity rather than a person who would do research in his lab.Secondly the passage states that the professor would become a celebrityforgetting the fact that he would confine himself to being a TV celebrity he would be busy preparing his presentation rather than improving his subject because TV networks give importance to his title and his material would be no better than a reporter who has done a little bit of homework.He would also not get chance to work with his fellow professors.FinallyI believe that a professor must confine himself to his labstudents etc.rather than appearing on TV.Question2: According to me young people enjoy their lives than old people because young people have strength to go out and see many places to gain the knowledge and also for entertainment. Young people have fresh ideas and they have strength to do anything i.e. whatever they want to do while old people do not have strength but they are wiser than young peoplesomething that they have gained through years of experience..Old people have a clear idea about certain situations which are going to happen in our life. But young people follow their ideas they don’t think about the further situations about that particular decision. The young people enjoy their life more than the old people. They go where ever they want to go. They have their own parties weekends etc. The old people are very important to the younger generation because the young people are busy with their work. They don’t have time to take care of their children. In this situation the children have to be taken care of by their grand parents. They can sustain their life easily. Because the grandparents tell stories to their grandchildren. In those stories they say many good things about the persons and the behaviour with the elders and the other people.The basic features can be learn from them has more importance than the things they learn from their parents. The characters which are from their grandparents are useful. The young can teach them how to think but the old people teach them how to think wisely. The conclusion of this topic is young people can enjoy than the old people. But the decisions can’t be taken wisely as the oldpeople.

They are finding that interesting even though the work assigned to them is tough. In such way he fulfilled the dreams of others by teaching them how to code and design and achieve their goals via computer programming on a large scale!
37,15,If we draw the points from the lecture and compare them with the content in the passage the lecture strongly opposes the information given in the passage about meerkats. In the passage it says that One of the meerkats stands guard and watch out for the predators while the other meerkats might be busy hunting and eating the food.The sentinel meerkat which stands as the guard does not eat any food and it is prone to danger from the predators. Also it has to escape alone when a predator attacks after raising an alarm.The lecture opposes some of the facts mentioned in the passage. Such asThe sentinel meerkat which stands as the guard has the food first and then does its duty with a full stomachAlso the sentinel meerkat is the first one to know when a predator is attacking so it raises the alarm and hides in its burrow thus escaping from the predatorIt does not worry about the other meerkats which are busy in their own work.There are more similarities than differences in the case of human beings. Both the lecture and the passage state that humans get a little reward or personal pride after performing an altruistic act.Young adults as we all are very aware of are in the state of utter immaturity. They are in the state of mind in which they assume that they have the wisdom and knowledge to make their own decisions. These young adults are mainly in the age of 16 to 22. The idea of leaving their parent and home mainly depends on the parents’ upbringing. If they have brought up their kids in a well disciplined manner but in the wrong way the kids definitely might want to enjoy their independece as soon as possible. So parents’ upbringing also plays a critical role in shaping the minds of their children.Other adults who prefer to live with their families for a longer time tend to have lovely caring and affectionate bonding towards their family members and especially with their parents. Such adults are nurtured in the right way and they do not feel the importance or the necessity to leave their home in their current situation.I particularly feel that parents must make sure they provide independence to their children when they have come up to the age and also providing independence does not mean getting rid of them. Parents have to make sure that their kids are of the right age and ensure that they are taking care of their responsibilities or not. Nowadays students in the age group of age 16 to 22 are lacking worldly knowledge and are always addicted to the technology. I feel this is wrong because however that is not the life we have signed up for. Students must make sure that they have clarity in all aspects and must not regret after taking a decisionOverall I feel that young adults must spend more time with their families rather than leaving them at the age where they need us the most. However you are not going to live with your parents until the end of your life. Also parents need their children to be with them so that they can make the most of their lives in their last years. So spending more time with families gives us the utmost satisfaction. In the chase of achieving your goals you must never forget the persons who gave you a life to survive on this planet!One shining example I can provide is me. I felt engineering is the phase where all of us are adults and can make our own decisions. My parents provided me with lot more than independence; they have joined me in the hostel. On the very 1st day after my parents left me I got to know or rather felt the importance of staying with family and parents. So I used to go home on every weekend and spend the time with my parents which obviously were the best days of the week.
37,2,Question 1A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie. List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them.MOVIE TITLE: TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES (TNMT)WHY: The introduction scene of TNMT is just too good! It is a perfect way to open an action packed movie. The scene involves introducing the four ninja turtles one by one with their names and the skills they can perform being displayed beside the respective turtle and being portrayed by the turtle itself! The very next scene involves all the four turtles in a fight sequence showing off their skills. The main reason about me liking this scene is that the turtles’ sense of humour plays a crucial part in the film. They never react even during fights. They crack jokes in between themselves and defeats their opponents. Also they help among themselves and perform stunts which act as an attraction magnet in the film!Question 1:MOVIE TITLE: SHERLOCK HOLMESWHY:This movie has definitely one of the most fantastic opening scenes among all other movies. The characters in this movie are being portrayed by Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law. Robert Downey Jr portrays the role of Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law as of Dr. Watson. The scene involves Sherlock and Watson saving a woman who is being crucified and tortured by Lord Blackwood. Blackwood would be performing black magic on the woman and Sherlock and Watson rescue her finally using their creativity and action skills. The most interesting part of this scene is where Sherlock detects a sharp instrument made of glass which is almost invisible to the eye and the way he helps Watson in not getting his eye pierced by the sharp object blows your mind! Overall this is one of the most exciting introduction scenes among the movies I have watched till now and I strongly recommend others to watch it too!Question 2The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer.Essay:“School days needs to be Longer or Shorter?” This is the new rising debate in our school. It all depends on the students’ priorities. Some students may be good at studies and some at sports. So it is up to us to decide what is good and what must be prioritised for the good upbringing of the children. We cannot just implement this longer days daily as the students might feel stressed and may not be active at home and might not involve in any other activities. Also we all know how much we used to hate our school days when we were made to sit for such long hours at school. But the problem with shorter days is that some of the students are neglecting their studies in the excessive involvement of sports. These are the problems with both the shorter and longer days. I have an idea so that all the students get time to focus on their studies as well as sports. The idea is to implement the longer and shorter days on alternate days of the week. I strongly believe that we get better results from the students in sports and studies as well. I feel this is the best way to educate the children in both the fields.
37,3,From: kaushiksai2395@gmail.comTo: ceo@yahoo.comSub: Plan of improvising the salesGood evening sirLately it has been difficult for us to cope up with other competing companies in the market. I have an idea which might help us to improve our sales. The idea is to increase the size of the outlet of the toothpaste tube so that customers will definitely apply more paste onto the brush. This way there is no need for us to increase the price and still can improve the sales because the customers will have to buy new ones as they will definitely use more if the outlet size is increased.If this idea works out then we can follow this more often so as to improve our sales all over the country.Thank youK.Kaushik SaiMSIT-IIITHIH201685037
37,4,Students can draw on a variety of sources to help them with writing assignments.First they can draw on personal experiences. For examplefor an assignment about communication skills a writer might think about the way he or shecommunicates through conversations with others while at work or at home.In addition a writer might look at ways he or she communicates with otherselectronically via email or texting or Facebook. Students might also findexamples of written communication skills by looking at skills they’ve learned for previouswriting assignments. Second student writers can look for ideasfrom other people’s experiences. For instance writers can interview otherstudents or even family members. Additionally a writer may have heardothers talk about this topic maybe in class. Another source would betelevision shows on the topic of communication. Finally college writers mayfind that they need to do some research to complete an assignment. As one can seelots of experts have written articles or books on the topic of communication skills.All in all a search of “communication skills” on the internet mightprovide useful information; Moreover reference librarians can help studentsfind research materials in special collections or databases. On the whole college writersneed to be able to draw on a combination of personal experience observations of othersand research materials to develop their written assignments.

37,8,In a celebration party a photographer who was busy capturing photos of the people who were enjoying thoroughly in the party at night. Among the lot no one seemed to care for the photographer and none of them noticed the struggle he was facing all by himself as there was no other photographer. It was a birthday Aditya and all his friends are at the party to wish him and enjoy the birthday night. The photographer was a male student of some other college and of the same age as every other student present at the party. The name of the photographer is Kaushik. Of all the friends present at the party Kaushik noticed a girl who has just entered the party. He felt a rush of feelings inside him and he immediately knew that he had fallen for her. This time the picture of the girl was captured without clicking the shutter button in his heart. The girl wore a smile on her face which can drive any guy crazy! Kaushik immediately rushed to Aditya and enquired about the girl. He got to know the name of the girl is Nitisha and she was a recent high school graduate. After capturing her photos for half an hour Kaushik felt alive at the party and was having the most wonderful time of his life. All thanks to Nitisha. He knew the party would come to an end soon and an important decision has to be made that night. After a big meal Kaushik somewhere felt that his love secret needs to be confessed to Nitisha as the party was about to end. Finally he took a leap of faith and introduced himself to Nitisha. She seemed interested in Kaushik as he looked handsome too but was a bit lean. Late at night Kaushik and Nitisha sat on the terrace and shared moments laughter memories etc. Finally he confessed to her for which she had to definitely say an “YES” as he was the most wonderful guy she has ever met. Kaushik still feels grateful to Aditya because that night Kaushik met his life partner and their love towards each other is endless. The couple remained happily ever after.

38,1,Question 1Movie Title : Pulp FictionPulp Fiction was released in 1994 and it’s opening sequence has to be the one of the best scene if not the best scene ever. The cinematography was beyond excellent. It created a sensation of sorts by introducing this trend where a part of the climax is taken and is kept as the opening scene.Movie Title : Fight ClubFight Club was released in 1999 and was known for it’s bold and daring narrative. The opening scene involves the protagonist and his alter-ego conversing which is one of the many highlights in the movie. Question 2Essay 1The one place which immediately comes to my mind when I think of vacation is Norway. Hands down. Nothing beats it’s spectacular Northern Lights or to be accurate the effect is called aurora borealis named after the Roman goddess of dawn. It is clearly visible at night against a dark sky. Also the world famous Norwegian fjords the spectacular mountains and glaciers are not to be forgotten. All in all it would be an all round experience of thrill and bliss and I’m sure I’ll be taking off soon.Essay 2In my opinion school is a place where children develop all round skills i.e the overall package of both education and physical activities. But if the board goes ahead and decides to extend the learning hours for students it is going to affect their sport practices which is important in the long run to maintain a healthy lifestyle. So it is my humble request to consider the one dimensional effect that is going to be casted on the students and scrap the idea of the extended learning hours.

38,3,Summarization of the points in the lecture:A recent study about meerket has revealed some interesting points. Their eating habits in particular have got quite an attention. The meerket which stand guard seem to do their job only after eating a lot of food. Also they are the ones to see the predator first so they have a better chance of escaping by running into the burrows nearby. The scattered animals in the group searching for food are in greater danger. Also the warning calls might influence behavior that might draw attention for the predators.Talking about altruism in people humans perform various kinds of altruistic acts. For example donating kidney to a relative or a stranger and other such selfless acts. Although it’s a great sacrifice it receives appreciation and non material rewards for the donor.ESSAY:There is a growing culture in the youth to seek independence from parents. This sense of feeling comes from the desire to explore different possibilities and living life on their own terms. For example in the US there is a large percentage of people who are just over 18 years and want to be independent. They want to be away from family life and make money without being dependent on their parents. Also most of the students leave for various colleges and thus are independent.There is another case where people are attached to their familes and do not want to go off living life on their own. They love the atmosphere that is invoked when you are in the environment surrounded by your loved ones. They tend to be emotionally attached thus making it difficult to be alone and independent. For example 65% of the people in India still live with their own families. It is not exactly possible to single out a better way to live because it totally depends on the person’s perception of his life. So the people have to make a wise decision about how they are gonna live their life.
38,4,SUMMARY OF THE VIDEOThe human voice it’s the instrument we all play with. It is the most powerful sound in the world but when few people speak they don’t have any listeners. The speaker points to the seven deadly sins which people tend to make when they speak. The foremost sin is gossip i.e speaking ill of someone. The second sin is judging. No one ever wants to listen when they are found wanted or someone is judging them. The next sin is negativity. It is hard to listen when someone is always talking negative stuff. The fourth sin is complaining. Complaining is thought of as viral and misery. The fifth sin is Excuses. When someone frequently resorts to excuses he is referred to as blame thrower. The penultimate sin is lying. Exaggeration out and out lying fall into this category. The final sin is dogmatism. It is hard to listen to people who frequently get confused with facts and try to convince others.The speaker then suggests the concept of HAIL. The general meaning of hail is to greet or acclaim enthusiastically. ‘H’ stands for honesty. ‘A’ stands for authenticity. ‘I’ stands for Integrity i.e standing by one’s word. ‘L’ stands for love. Here love refers to caring for people.The speaker then concludes by sharing the notion that sound should be created consciously and consumed consciously. It really is an idea worth spreading.

Can you shoot me back and email and tell me what’s up with the application process?When I was browsing through career websites this week I noticed that your company has an opening for an intern this summer. I think I would fit well into the position. So could you please mail me the details regarding the application process?
38,6,1Q) Why should managers and software engineers pay attention to the costs involved in software development documentation?A)All large software development projects irrespective of application generate a large amount of associated documentation. For moderately sized systems the documentation will probably fill several filing cabinets; for large systems it may fill several rooms. A high proportion of software process costs is incurred in producing this documentation. Furthermore documentation errors and omissions can lead to errors by end-users and consequent system failures with their associated costs and disruption. Therefore managers and software engineers should pay as much attention to documentation and its associated costs as to the development of the software itself.2Q) What are the types of documents that may be required during the development process of software? A) 1. Process documentation - These documents record the process of development and maintenance. Plans schedules process quality documents and organizational and project standards are process documentation. 2. Product documentation - This documentation describes the product that is being developed. System documentation describes the product from the point of view of the engineers developing and maintaining the system; user documentation provides a product description that is oriented towards system users.3. System documentation includes all of the documents describing the system itself from the requirements specification to the final acceptance test plan. Documents describing the design implementation and testing of a system are essential if the program is to be understood and maintained. Like user documentation it is important that system documentation is structured with overviews leading the reader into more formal and detailed descriptions of each aspect of the system.3Q) What type of documents goes into process documentation?A) Process documentation falls into a number of categories: 1. Plans estimates and schedules - These are documents produced by managers which are used to predict and to control the software process. 2. Reports - These are documents which report how resources were used during the process of development. 3. Standards - These are documents which set out how the process is to be implemented. These may be developed from organizational national or international standards.4. Working papers - These are often the principal technical communication documents in a project. They record the ideas and thoughts of the engineers working on the project are interim versions of product documentation describe implementation strategies and set out problems which have been identified. They often implicitly record the rationale for design decisions. 5. Memos and electronic mail messages - These record the details of everyday communications between managers and development engineers.4Q) Why does process documentation become outdated frequently?A) The major characteristic of process documentation is that most of it becomes outdated. Plans may be drawn up on a weekly fortnightly or monthly basis. Progress will normally be reported weekly. Memos record thoughts ideas and intentions which change. Although of interest to software historians much of this process information is of little real use after it has gone out of date and there is not normally a need to preserve it after the system has been delivered. However there are some process documents that can be useful as the software evolves in response to new requirements.5Q) What is the role of working papers in software development?A) These are often the principal technical communication documents in a project. They record the ideas and thoughts of the engineers working on the project are interim versions of product documentation describe implementation strategies and set out problems which have been identified. They often implicitly record the rationale for design decisions.
38,7,WRITING TASK 1The narrator in the lecture is not convinced that professors really benefit from doing TV shows. The passage says that professors acquire a lot of reputation among a much wider audience than compared to campus but the professors are not considered serious scholars from the standpoint of other professors. Also a lot of time gets wasted preparing for the TV show. They should ponder upon what to represent and also they have to spend time to look good in the show. The narrator suggests that all that wasted time could be used for research. It is mentioned in the passage that public gains from professor's appearing on television because they have a chance to learn from experts and get exposed to different views.The narrator questions if public truly benefit from such appearances. She explains that most of the TV networks don't care for in the in depth knowledge. All they require is the in depth topic. They focus on the deeper side of the current events and movie version of the great historical art themes. WRITING TASK 2It’s not necessary that younger people enjoy more than the older ones. It all depends on the perception of what gives you happiness. The common belief that younger people have more fun stems from the fact they like to hangout at coffee shops and are more prone to drinking and smoking than the older ones. Just because the older people don’t do all the above doesn’t mean they are not enjoying. Their idea of enjoying is too mature for the likes of the younger generation to understand.My dad for example enjoys life more than me. He is always willing to learn something new daily and that gives him happiness. He doesn’t depend upon external help for solving wide range of issues that keep popping up every day. He takes joy from all the underrated pleasures that life keeps offering to us. I on the other hand lead a very routine life. The packed schedule I go through every day doesn’t leave me with any moment to spare. In my shell life that I lead it would be an absolute crackerjack of a day if I had time to breathe. So relatively speaking I can say with utmost confidence that my dad enjoys life more than me.So it doesn’t really matter if you are young or old all that matters is the life you lead and your idea of enjoying life.
39,1,Task-1Altruism Each and every mammal on the earth will think of the survival of their group by taking risk in their life. Their behavior is totally unselfish and even nothing is gained by being altruism. Altruism means a behavior by sacrificing their interest and think of other’s. When we look at human beings some of them will donate eyes kidneys and blood; in reverse they don’t expect anything from the person who’s taking the parts. By being altruism they don’t think of themselves and will think of survival of another person. When it comes to animals for example meerkat present in Africa this is the animal which will look after the group of meerkat’s while in search of food. A group meerkat’s dwells in burrows in grassland search for the food and eat the food. Whereas one meerkat will be as a guard in front of the burrows and protects other meerkat’s. When there is any danger to the group it will raise an alarm by keeping its own life at risk. There is more risk for the meerkat which will be the guard because it should raise an alarm and it should think of safety. By this time the meerkat will be in more danger and has no chance to escape from danger. The meerkat which acts as guard will gain nothing and even does not get food for the time being. Meerkat sometimes may also die for the safety of other meerkat’s. This is the unselfish with scarifying their own interest. Task-2: According my opinion adults should be independent from their parents. When a child after reaching particular age they should be given independence they’ll get to know many things by their own. And even they’ll learn how to survive in the world. By depending on their parents some the adults are not knowing how to get into the world of individuality. And even some adults who depend on their parents do not know what to without them. One movie in Malayalam named ‘mili’ where role actress is totally dependent on her father and do not mingle with society. Even if the girl lost her job she has a confident that her father is going to push into other job. But at one particular time her father tried her to be independent. At that time the actor does not know what to do and tried to commit suicide. However in that movie with the help of another actor’s motivation she found her job by herself and made her father more proud. But when it comes to reality there is no chance for the person like ‘mili’ to get into new life and they try to end their life for no reason. When we look at other example there is a boy who depends on their parents and has a confidence that his father is going to push into any of the field. With that confidence that boy not even completed the graduation and free just passing the time. Even his sister has completed her graduation. For now he’s feeling ashamed and not getting another chance to prove himself. So I conclude saying that adults should be independent from parents but should have support from their parents. They should have confidence that they can achieve anything. Even if they lose anything also parent support should be there. Because of depression they may even commit suicide and end their life.
39,10,Task - 1Why should managers and software engineers pay attention to the costs involved in software development documentation?Managers and software engineers should pay attention to the costs involved in software development documentation because if any failures or any misleading data in the documentation will lead to errors by the end user. And they also lead to system failures which will crash the system and many installation costs are occurring.What are the types of documents that may be required during the development process of software? Types of documents are:A document which acts like a barrier between the development team and member.System repository information which is used by maintenance engineers.The documents which are helpful for planning and scheduling the software development process.The documents which will help end user to use and administer the system.What type of documents goes into process documentation? Types of documents in process documentation:Plans estimates and schedules: These documents are used to predict and check the control of the software process. These documents are produced by managers.Reports: During the development these documents are used to report how resources are used.Standards: These documents are developed from organizational national or international standards. And these documents will give the process implementation.Working papers: The ideas and thoughts of engineers who are working on the project are recorded.Memos and electronic mail messages: The day-to-day communication between managers and team members is recorded.Why does process documentation become outdated frequently? The records which are there in the process documentation because they may change based on weekly fortnightly or monthly basis.What is the role of working papers in software development? The working papers are the principal technical documentations in a project. The ideas which are recorded are given by the engineers who are working on the project.

39,2,EssayYoung people enjoy life more than the older people do.In my opinion yes it is true: the young people enjoy life more than the older do. A few years ago these old people are the young people who enjoyed their life. When a person becomes old there will be more responsibilities and the person will be in the stage of earning. But when coming to young he/she will not have any responsibilities and he/she is dependent on the parents so there will be no restrictions.An old person has already crossed the young age has tasted the essence of enjoyment and will now have more and more responsibilities of the family. He/she will be having children and a partner and he will think more about the family rather than thinking of enjoying life. At the young age the people are free from the seriousness of life.The youngsters are easily addicted when he/she is habituated to enjoy in the life he’ll not think of anything. And moreover the youngsters have not experienced any struggles in the life. The older one will be employed and he is not free all the time to go out but when coming to young people there are no restrictions for them from parents and even from colleges. He/she is freer to do anything.So according to me the young people enjoy their life more than the older. But the old people are the one who came from their younger age enjoying.PassageIs Beneficial to Professors to appear on TV Shows?Points in Recording:Professors appearing in TV Shows may be beneficial but not all times.Some of the professors may come to TV show just to entertain people and they’ll provide any information. At this time the university may get down its reputation. The professors who are attending the TV shows are not calling for any university meetings academic discussions and some other important conferences.Professors they don’t even get money for doing researches they themselves should earn.A lot time is wasted for the professor because; when he/she is coming to the TV Show he should be well prepared. So he should have time to prepare time for rehearsal time to travel to the recording place.Even time is wasted for him/her to look good because he appears in front of many viewers.Although it is beneficial to universities but sometimes people will think that the professor is always giving TV Shows then when is teaching for the students.Already the material is available in many of the journals. Whatever he/she is presenting in the TV will not be more than the data available in journals.Points in Passage:The professors appearing on TV Shows will benefit more to the themselves even universities and also the general public.When a professor appears on television he acquires reputations in their academic fields and also among the audience.Whenever a professor publishes his views in a journal no one will be aware of that information. But whenever a professor appears on TV all the audience will improve knowledge and also people gain knowledge whoever are unaware of the topic.The audience who are impressed by the views of the professor will think about the college he is working. And by this way universities get benefited.Even the university will get more donations and applications from students.Even public will also gain knowledge from professors. Some people don’t know how to get their doubts clarified but if the topic is related to the TV show presentation then he/she will gain more knowledge.And his/her doubts will resolve for sometimes.

The Sydney Harbour and it’s historic culture are the major highlight of Sydney. I can’t wait to go there and the typing all the features written above is making me feel like taking off right now.Essay-2The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer. The capacity to learn is a gift. The ability to learn is a skill. The willingness to learn is a choice. Learning is a gift which is not provided for all. So the education provided should be proper. Implementing a longer school day by school board is not a good idea. Because students should have skill not only in education but also in other activities. If the board decides to go ahead with the decision to implement longer school days it is going to have an adverse effect on the students all round skills. Also they might loose interest in school because of the tedious daily routine. So it is my sincere request to not extend the school hours and help grow the students as a whole.

4,11,Professors are normally found in university classrooms offices and libraries doing research and giving lecture to their students.Sometimes professors appear as guests on television programs giving expert commentary on the latest events in the world. By appearing on tv shows there are so many benefits to the professors and as well as to the universities.Professors by appearing on television benefit as they acquire reputations as authorities in their academic fields to a wider audience. But at the same time when they appear on tv thousands of people outside the academic community become more aware of the professor’s ideas. The professor’s importance as scholars will be enhanced.Universities also benefit from such appearances they receive positive publicity when their professor’s appear on tv. When the people see a knowledgeable professor they think highly more of that university. In that Way University gains reputation among the public. This in other way turn leads to donations and applications from students. Students will have a positive impression on that university.Finally public gains a lot from professors appearing on the television. Because when a professor publishes views in an academic journal only other scholars would know and appreciate the views.Common public are nowhere interacted with the professors. When they appear on tv viewers has a chance to learn from experts about the new events which are happening in the world. So finally it is better that when professors appear on tv everybody will be benefitted. Young people enjoy life more than older people doIn my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people because of so many reasons. Old people have crossed the enjoyment stage in their life as they have already seen the enjoyment. Young people generally have all the activities in the life. They are ready to face any kind of situation in their life but the old people could not face all kinds of situations. Young people are able to understand all types of things happening in the world but the old people face some troubles understanding the things.Young people have too many events in a day whereas the old people don’t have young people are engaged with the world in too many ways whereas the old people don’t get engaged with the world. Young people don’t have responsibilities to that much extent so they are exposed to enjoy whereas the old people have some kind of responsibilities for which they could not enjoy much extent. Health issues matters a lot between the two age groups. As the age grew older quality of body functioning decreases. So old people could not dare to do which are risky and also enjoyable. Young people are strong and stubborn to dare any kind of things to happen as the body functioning would be strong. So finally young people enjoy a lot when compared to old people.

40,1,Reading Passage tells about the advantages of University Professors being as a guest in Television. These Television appearances are great benefit to them as well as to their Universities but in the lecture professor tells us that there are disadvantages. Firstly it is not good for professor to be on Television. Whenever a professor appears on Television his reputaion among other professors will decrease.Professors are rated according to their academic excellence and their research papers. Secondly it is a waste of time being on Television because students who are under respective professors will get effected in their academics. If a professor is away from students then he get a bad reputation.In the reading passage it is quite opposite what was said in the lecture. They've mentioined that being as a guest in televison will help the professors in many ways. Ofcourse professors can explain everything on tv but it lacks the practicality of the work. TV reporters can explain the same thing whatever the professors gonna say then there is no need of professors for that. People get benifitted form those lectures but they cannot attain complete knowledge. Professors should maintain some dignity in the society as they will provide foundation to their students and gain good reputaion in the society. TV is to entertain whereas University professors are there to enhance the tought process.
40,2,Eventhough young people are more outgoing than older people I don't agree with the statement. Old aged persons are mostly retired and have more time to go on trip and travels but young people do not have more time to travel. Because young people are busy with their proffession but they are more interested to go out and make new experiences. In comparison older people already have a lot of experience and they often just want to visite places where they have been before rather than go on exciting trips.However older peole often have problems with their health and therefore they are not as flexible as young people are. Older people are more interested in their own family which is often the most important topic in their lives. And to my opinion it is far better to see your own grantchildren growing up than going into discos and stay up all night what a lot of younger people do.To sum up the main points I do not think that younger people enjoy their life more than older people do because there are so many things that older people can do which younger can not do. To my opinion older people enjoy their lifes different than younger people do but there is no better way.

In the reading paragraph it is said that the professors appearing on television is good for themselves for the university where they work and for the public because by this it will get good reputation to the professor as well as the university. But the lecture disagrees with this opinion because the lecture says that if professors participate on TV programs it actually effects their reputation since the people consider they are not serious about the doing research and they are more concerned about entertainment than academic issues and reading is exactly opposite to the lecture it said doing so the professors are viewed as authorities in the subject.2. The lecturer also disagrees with reading that the public gains from professor appearing on TV. He said that the television is doing this programs to get publicity and not for providing knowledge to the people. So the information delivery is not different from something delivered from a reporter that has made she or he home work and people will become more conscious on their appearance of him/her in tv rather than the lecture and the lecture says that appearing on TV takes time from the professor to prepare what he or she have to present on the TV and the time will also be wasted in travelling. This time that could be used by the professor to attend students or doing research for example. But the reading says that when professors appear on TV the public or children has the chance of learning from experts by listening to their lectures and the passages also says that the appearance of professors on TV can bring publicity to the university so it increases donations student applications and it also increases reputation to professors and there is also chance of getting good research opportunities. Q2) Young people enjoy life more than old people do?Yes according to me i totally agree to the above statement that “young people enjoy life more than old people do” because younger people have much more energy passion to do things and they will have very less responsibilities compared to the older people and i have also seen the old people who were unable to enjoy their lives and they remain sad for enjoying their lives as we do. For example my grandfather who has to take care of his family and he had to earn money to he has to maintain family. The technology has also become an important thing in our life as a part of the enjoyment. For example we are using social media applications like whatsapp and facebook and many other apps to connect people and we can also go out and enjoy the late nights. But older people can only connect with their friend with traditional method which is only couple friends with some boundaries and most of the people are unable to use the technologies which this generation are using. So that is why i think that young people can able to enjoy life by being less responsible more energetic and more following up new things.

41,6,TASK 1:Q)summarize the points made in the lecture being sure to explain how they oppose specific points made in the reading passageAns: Altruism is type of behavior in which an animal sacrifices its own interest for that animal or group of animals .Altruism is the opposite of selfishness; individuals performing altruistic acts gain nothing for themselves.The best example of altruism is humans and other mammals. Unselfish acts of the human being like helping others sharing the food or other things with other people with others but they are not given any rewards the people share their belongings even with the strangers. In many cases we can see sharing food in common with both humans and other mammals. The human beings are also sacrificing their body organs for the family members for example kidneys but by doing this they don't get any advantage or rewards it's just sacrificing. There is another example of meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa acts as a sentinel standing guard and looking out for predators while the others hunt for food or eat food they have obtained. if the meerkat sees a predator approach it gives an alarm or cry alert to other meerkats to run and seek the shelter but the meerkat do not guard unless they complete their eating. so the altruistic sentinel behavior helps ensure the survival of other members of the meerkat group.TASK 2:Q)some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. other young adults prefer to live with their parents for a longer time. which situation do you think is better ?Ans: The young adults should have both the independence and they should be under the family for longer time because if the young adults are given more independence there is a chance of misusing the freedom . But most of the young adults feel that they should have some freedom but according to me the young adults should be under the guidance of parents because at that age the children will not get fully matured so it is better for young adults to stay under their guidance and by doing this we can also know how to behave and how to mingle with the society .This makes young adults a better adult. But i feel that young adults should also have independence because if the young adults are restricted they may get mentally disturbed and they may not be able to live in the society effectively and for example my parents have given me freedom of choice in going to higher studies or job likewise every adult should be given independence to do what they want to do. so it's better to have independence under parents so that there is no chance of misusing the freedom as well as they will also get to know how to grow into a better person

44,1,Question1:MOVIE TITLE: BAHUBALI.WHY: I like the introduction scene of Bahubali an epic film of telugu film industry most. In the introduction scene of Bahubali one lady named Sivagami comes from a cave carrying a baby named Mahindra Bahubali. Two men follows her to kill that baby but surprisingly that lady kills the two men following her. Later her leg is slipped while she is walking and falls in a river and is sunk in the river but she saves the baby by lifting him with his hand. After watching that scene I was excited like anything with some doubts. They are who is that woman and why those two men are following that lady and want to kill the baby. Moreover why is she trying to save that baby. With all of these questions I was very much excited.MOVIE TITLE: WHY: I like the introduction scene of Magadheera very much. The scene was a couple of lovers were fallen down from a big mountain for the sake of their love and a man looking like a king cremated the crown of the man(one of the lovers). By watching this movie I was confused with a lot of questions like who were the lovers? what was happened before that introduction scene? why they both were felled down themselves. With all of these questions I was very much excited. So this excitement makes me to like that introduction scene.Question 2: Favourite placeIf I have a vacation to go anywhere in this world then I will go to Taj Mahal one of the seven wonders of the world situated in Agra. As the name indicates the Taj Mahal is like a Raj mahal. Taj Mahal was built by an moghal emperor named Shah Jahan. Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal as a memory of his wife Muntaj. Moreover the name Taj Mahal was derived from the name of Muntaj. Everyone in their life should visit Taj Mahal atleast once. Taj Mahal was built in 1638 by Shah Jahan. It was built with an ivory marble which is white in colour. Because of its colour Taj Mahal very much attracts the tourist people who is coming from all over the world. Not only Indian people but people from other countries also come to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. 7-8 million people come from all over the indis to visit the Taj Mahal. The Taj Mahal has a beautiful and big garden around it which attracts the people most. There is a river called Yamuna which is flowing beside the Taj Mahal. Though the pollutants from the river Yamuna are polluting the marble of the Taj Mahal it is stll looks very much attractive and looking like white palace. By seeing Taj Mahal our eyes also get relaxed thereby giving us pleasure. So because of these reasons I want to go to visit Taj Mahal whenever I get a vacation. I strongly recommend you also to visit Taj Mahal the seventh wonder of the world. It will be cool to visit not only Taj Mahal any place which gives us a pleasure. LONGER SCHOOL DAYNow a days not only education makes the students perfect but sports also make better. In today’s world students are studying well and at the same time they are undergoing much stress because of their studies at that time sports may help them to get relax. The longer school day will not help the students in achieving their goals because education alone doesn’t satisfy the students. Moreover there should be equal importance for studies and education in the students life in order to get success. Not only education helps the students in getting jobs but there are some jobs which are given to sports persons also. If there is a longer school day students may not concentrate on just only on studies. There should be exercises for students in order to increase their concentration. As researches told students playing sports are more healthier that the students who are not playing and just concentrating only in studies. So we should give equal importance for studies and sports. Therefore it is better to not implement the longer school day. As the students can’t concentrate on studies if they are studying 24 hours some of the time should be allocated to sports and exercises. So keeping the above points in consideration please do not implement the longer school day.

44,3,CREATIVE WRITING ASSIGNMENTMy name is Bhaskar. I’m a college student. I am doing MSIT course in IIIT Hyderabad. One day I had gone to my workshop conducted by our soft skills mentors without formal wear (formal shoes) so our mentors didn’t allow me in to the workshop. Then I took a decision to buy new shoes at any cost. As soon as I took the decision I went to a shopping mall where we can find everything even gold also. While entering in to the mall there was no security men at the entrance who checks the customers and I did not wait for him and went in to the mall. In the mall I had quested for shoes but I didn’t find them for my taste. So then I wanted to return to home. While crossing the security check from the mall one of the checking men had stopped me and asked me “Sir sorry to interrupt you I have to check you?”. I said “sure with pleasure.” He checked me and found a watch in my pocket. He asked me whether I had stolen it? I replied “no I did not steal it”. He didn’t trust me. After a fight he had asked me to pay the price of the watch and I paid it. After I went home with wan face my brother asked me why was i so sad? “Something embarrassing has just happened.” I replied. Then I explained the entire story to him. Then he said that I had been asking him for a watch since a long time so to surprise me he only kept that watch in my pocket and said sorry. I was frustrated and then I realized that if I would wait for security while entering in to the mall and showed my watch I would have not faced that situation. So our carelessness complicates our life.
44,4,EMAIL WRITINGDear RamSub: Feedback on Your PerformanceMr. Ram first of all congratulations for the success of the latest prestigious project of our team. You are performing well in our team but in some aspects you have to improve. As a team leader it is my responsibility to give feedback on your performance. The main aim of this mail is to inform you the aspects which you are lagging in.Mr. Ram I have been observing your team skills continuously since your joining in our company.

44,5,TASK-1How the lecture opposes some points given in the passageIn the lecture the person explains about altruistic nature of the some of the living species such as humans animals. In the paragraph it is explained that animals sacrifice their own interests and even life for the sake of others. For example mammals like meerkats which lives in groups has a senitel meerkat. What that senitel meerkat does is it acts as a safeguard to the members of group and saves the group while other members go to hunt and eat food. If any predator comes near by the group first the senitel meerkat makes an alarming cry so that all the rest go to their shelters or form in a group. The points that were opposed by the speaker from the passage is that in the passage the altruistic nature can be seen in animals only like mammals. But the speaker tells about the altruistic nature of humans also since many humans sacrifice food and body organs for their relatives some times for others. So in this way humans also have altruistic nature as well as animals TASK-2Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better In my point of view living with parents is better rather than getting freedom from them because parents are the only care takers of us in the entire universe. So living with them helps us in many ways. If we want to freedom means you are avoiding them which is not the correct thing because they may miss us and they want you with us. if you want freedom even you also sometimes feel lonely ness. If we want independence we can get if for some time but independence or freedom for a long time is not a good idea. Seeking independence may lead to the negative impression on us in the parents. So finally what I want to say is that living with parents is more better than seeking independence from them.
44,6,TASK1The human voice that’s the instrument we all play. It is the most powerful sound in the world probably. It is the only one that can start a war or say “I love you”. He(The author) is not pretending this is an exhaustive list but these seven I think are pretty large habits that we can all fall into.First gossip  Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. Not a nice habit and we know perfectly well the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us.Second judging. We know people who are like this in conversation and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same timeinutes later will be gossiping about us.Third negativity. You can fall into this. My mother in the last years of her life became very negative and it's hard to listen.And finally volume. We can get really excited by using volume. Sorry about that if I startled anybody. Or we can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting.Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice.

44,9,Writing SectionTASK -1Normally professors are found in universities libraries and class rooms giving lectures to the students. However some professors gives lecture on television. By doing so they can get authority on the topics on which they gave the lecture. By giving lecture in television the importance of the professor will be enhanced. The professor contradicts the points given in the passage in many ways. They are discussed below. In the lecture the professor explained about whether the lectures given by some professors are really useful i.e. whether does anybody get benefitted by those lecture? The professor in the lecture said that many professors gave lecture on television just for entertainment not to educate the general public or students. The television channels just think about their ratings and they do not encourage real scholars to give lectures on their channels but they want professors who can entertain the audience well. The professor in the lecture also said that when the professors are giving lectures on the television they are not available for the students to clarify their doubts. It is also be disadvantageous also for the professors giving the lectures on television because to give the lectures on television the professor do make up for him and also he want to make notes of that lecture. This all are the time waste process. During this time the professor might do research on a topic. The professor also said that to give lectures on television great scholar is not required anybody who can make notes can give lecture on TV. TASK-2Young people enjoy more than older peopleIn my opinion young people enjoy more than older people in many ways. Young people have many advantages to enjoy rather than older people. Older people cannot go outside alone because at that age they may have several problems like B.P sugar and some other problems. For example young people can go to a movie and enjoy the film in the case of older people it is different why because many of the older people have eye sight and they cannot watch the movie not only the movie they cannot enjoy the nature also. In other case many of the old people do have sugar so they do not eat sweets like young people. Old people cannot run and play like young people because at that age their body does not support them to play. Nowadays people who got the age of 60 cannot enjoy like young people. Older people cannot do adventures like older people because older people does not have the body fitness like young people. Older people does not get a chance to many participate in many events unlike young people. Some of the events are like dancing playing.
45,1,Altruism is a type of behaviour or mentality of a particular individual who sacrifices his/her own comforts for the existence of his fellow beings. In case of animals sometimes people generally misunderstand the behaviour of these animals let us take an example of the meerkat found in the grasslands of Africa it acts as stand guard and gives an alarm cry to the group whenever a predator like a hawk is seen approaching to any general analysis this would appear to be like an act of selflessness or altruism but the meerkat is actually safeguarding itself and by giving the alarm call the meerkat is diverting the attention of the predator Coming to human beings known as social animals altruism is considered as the main difference between animals and human beings but there is still a selfish motive related to the altruistic nature they show but the benefits are almost immaterial so though there is a slight difference between humans and the animals the point to be noticed is they expect something in return.Independence Children are cared taught and are loved the most by the parents right from their birth to a certain age that is when they become majors or enter the adulthood but now a days there is a concept which is mostly prevalent in the western countries and is also slowly entering Asia. The western world has always followed this concept which is once the child is major he or she should be in a position to earn their own bread this thing automatically disconnects most of the things which the children were earlier attached to their parents so sometimes children out of peer pressure or due to the attraction of this new world they are about see in a few years start seeking it even more earlier this way of thinking is actually an external ideology this is not an internal process of ideas so I disagree with teenagers who want freedom and put do not disturb sign boards on their bedroom doors.Where as in the other part of this world children even after growing old enough still depend on their parents this is can be understood as taking for sure as if someone would work for them .My side is that children should openly share their pressures and failures with their parents to get help but having independence in an immature state of mind is not a good decision and the same with the second case children try to depend on their parents even after growing old enough. I believe that children should be with their parents till they grow old enough to make decisions on their own.

45,6,Starting with the positive points of a professor appearing on TV a professor gains huge reputation among his fellow professors and also among the common folks which in turn brings the university Large amount of donations and also it can be useful for their potential students.It also provides the common audience with required basic information about a particular topic .There are also very important cons towards this commercialism for an university professor.an university professor is expected to do research or meet students are probably teaching which is considered to be very productive work for any professor to do but if he/she spends his/her time on these kind of fancy stuff then there productive time is being spend in an unproductive way this is because no TV show is going to deal any topic in depth and there is no need for a [professor who deals with subjects in depth to explain it on TVfor that matter any TV reporter if a good homework is done can easily reproduce that matter for the audience. The most important drawback for those professors who actually participate in these TV shows is they will not be invited for big discussions on a particular subject when all the experts come to discuss on the topic which is a very bad for their professional carer.from both the sources of information a conclusion can be drawn that professors are the most dedicated professionals in the society and they are expected to have a great social responsibility by being commercial and dreaming of popularity a professor might loose his very essence of his profession. The phrase is an open ended question so let us deal with it using a simple analysis.every human passes through both the stages of the life when a person is young he is free from responsibilities and is just responsible for himself he is not bored of any routine stuff he is free to chose his careerhis favorite food clothesBecause in youth every one has only one motive that is “am I happy today ?”so one can draw a conclusion from this analysis that people tend to be happy in their youth rather than their old-agethis is because a man’s thought becomes actions and his actions behavior so the whole lifestyle of any youngster is to enjoy. Nevertheless it depends on the economic and the family conditions of the individual.People in the old age have every right to enjoy and live their life because they faced three fourth of their life and struggled to get to that position but they have their limitations like health issueslow energy levels even they have money and freedom to enjoy their lives but because of the limitations they just relax but it again depends totally on the individual some are very young in their attitude and blood they are still 20 at 60 they take risks to just enjoy.So by the analysis that is been done in the above two passages we conclude that youngsters or old people both of them have thorns which keep on choking them through out our lives but it is only the attitude that matters not the age.
46,1,They are opposing because of these specific reasons. First if the professors are concentrating on television shows they can’t spend more time on research. If professors spend more time in research then can find new things. Sometimes they may not get resources for their research if they spend more time on television appearances. Scholars and research fellows may not get proper guidance for their research. Universities can’t get reputation if there is no professor to teach the students. Professors have to conduct more number conferences and works shops in research field this gives encouragement to young students and they become scientists. They have to share their ideas with the students and they have to publish their journals and research work. To do all these things professors have to spend more time on their work and they have to lot of work. So finally appearing on TV shows is not good for professors. Young people enjoy life more than older people doI agree with this statement because of the following reasons.When we are young we don’t care about money and our responsibility about family burdens. We only take care about ourselves friends games movies girlfriends and boyfriends. When we are young we know only how to spend money and how to enjoy but when we started earning money then we will know how our parents faced difficulties while they were earning money. Parents always bother about their child but children never bother about parents. When we are young our parents will take care about our health our schooling our food and everything about us. So young people enjoy life as parents giving anything they want.On the other side older people can’t enjoy the life as young people can do. Why because they have so many responsibilities about their family and their work. They have to maintain the family and they have to make the money. Older people don’t have that much of energy as younger people have. Even though have to work for the family because it’s their responsibility. Finally I can say that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

47,12,RollNo:IH201685047Writing based on experience and knowledge:Young people do enjoy their lives more when compared to old people to some extent why because people at an early age don't have much responsibilities regarding family issuesjobexpenditure and so on whereas when people grow-up the responsibilities incerases in such a manner that they have to look after their familyjobexpenditurehealth and everything.So as people grow-up they spent most of the time to undertake their responsibilities rather than enjoying their individual life.So old people do enjoy their lives that is their enjoyment lies in making their family happier but young people have their own individual enjoyment.This is one reason to say that young people enjoy life more than older people. On the other hand there are some people who are born for enjoyment.They find enjoyment in every aspect of their life irrespective of their ages.Even though young people may not have responsibilities regarding familyjob and expenditure but they do have responsibilities regarding their education.But in education along with learning they find enjoyment in setting their career dreams and get them done.In our lives we meet many new friendschill out with friends for moviesshopping at weekendsshare our thoughts where we find enjoyment.So people at an early age enjoy their lives in fulfilling their own dreamsand when they grows-up they find their enjoyment in fulfilling their responsibilities to their family. I hereby conclude that whatever age you are at you should try to enjoy your life.Success and failures are common in everyones life.Even if we fail in any of the aspects one should try to learn from that experience so that you can use the things you learned by which you can succeed.So try to be positive and enjoy your life as much as you can irrespective of your ages.Writing based on reading:When professors appear on television they themselvesalong with their universities and general public gets benefited why because they acquire reputations as authorities in their academic fields in a wider way than they have on campus.If a professor publishes views in an academic journalonly a few will learn about and appreciate those views whereas when a professor appears on TVthousands of people outside the narrow academic community will view those ideas therby the professor's importance will enhance.Also when the professor appears on television the universities also benefit as people see a knowledgable faculty member of university and they think high about the university to which the professor belongs.This reputation in turn leads to more donations for the university and more applications from potential students.Finallythe public who have no chance to learn from experts gets exposed to multiple new ideas otherwise by which they never hear about.The viewers get a taste of real expertise and insight.Writing based on listening:If professors appear on television it wastes lot of their time in preparing what to presenttime to traveltime to get ready and to get the show shooting done.Instead of wasting his time he can spend his time on research so that he can grow in his career.Also the television networks want the professors to discuss academic titles but not intellectual subjects.So public can get that academic titles from television editor rather than watching his lecture on television which would be of no use.
47,13,Altruism is a type of behavior in which an animal sacrifies its own interest for that of another animal or group of animalswhich is opposite of selfishness and individuals performing altruistis acts gain nothing for themselves.Coming to the point of altruism of in mammals namely meerkatsIn the passage it is mentioned that meerkatwhich is a mammal acts as a senitalstanding guard and looking out for predators such as hawk which approaches the groupit gives an alarm cry alerting the other meerkats in the group to run and sheek shelter and by standing guard it gains nothing that is it goes without food while others eatand it places itselt in grave danger while the others hunt for food or eat food they have obtained.According to the audio it is mentioned that meerkats eat before they act as a standing guard and they stand near the burrows while alarming so that they can readily escape from any of the predators.Also there is a chance that predators can find where did the alarm come from and easily trace the place in which the meerkats are present Coming to the point of altruism of in mammals namely meerkatsIn the passage it is mentioned that humans altruistis acts ranges from sharing of food with strangers to the donation of body organs to family members and even to strangers where the one who is performing the acts gains nothing yet they are provided with little reward to the one performing the actAccording to the audio it is questioned whether the people who are performing this altuistic act are really appreciatedand if those people are really appreciated it leads to the increase of self worth Family relationship is the strongest relationship than any other relationships in the world.As per my opinion the young adults who prefer s to live with their families for long time is better when compared to the young adults who want independence from their parents as soon as possible.Being a young adult you might not be having much experience in solving critical problems so if you live with your family you will be receiving total support in any of the aspects as they are much experienced in all these problems in their life.As you need the support of your family at your young agethey too need your support when are grown-up.Our parents sacrifice their whole life in earning money and providing us everything from basic needs like food clothingshelter to education.They even starve for us because our lives are important for them than theirs.So it is our minimum responsibility to look after them when we are grown-up.If you have a good family relationship you can be very confident even in your worst cases as they supportmotivate and boost-up your levels.In olden days when the joint families are high in number the rate of divorce after marriage is very low but now where the joint families are rare to find the rate of divorce after marriage is very high.It is not that being in a joint family or not is the only reason for the growth rate of divorce but what I mean to convey is being with your family will be an added advantage because they can guide youteach life lessons from their experiencesmotivate you when you are depressed and short-tempered.In this modern world because of their career and job it is not possible for everyone to stay with their families but inspite of all your busy schedule you should spend a minimum of ten minutes a day to talk to your family over phone and also make a chance of visiting your home now and then whenever time permits.If you are good at your parents then your child will be good at you in future as they learn lessons from you.

You can describe the academic and social activities at your college and any unique aspects of your learning environment.It was June 132016.Early in the morning I woke up at 6:00 am in the morning. It was the deciding day of my career because I got a mail stating that I am short listed to attend an IELTS exam followed by counselling through which I can secure seat in MSIT which would provide me a chance to be a student of IIITH.I started at 11:am from home and it took 2 hours to reach the place where I have to attend for the counseling session.After reaching there I am informed that there is no IELTS exam and I can directly attend for the process of counselling. By hearing the news I got relaxed to some extent. There are only 160 seats in IIITH where the competitors are too high. Even though MSIT course is offered in some other universities like JNTUHJNTUKJNTUA majority of the students are willing to take the course in IIITH as it is one of the most prestigious institutions in our country. We are asked to sit in a hall where all the students and parents gathered there. After some time I started to interact with the other students and when I asked a few students about their scores and the range of their scores is 1500-1800 out of 2400.My score was 1535 in GAT and I am very tensed thinking whether I could secure a seat in IIITH or not. Even though if I miss IIITH I know that I would definitely secure a seat in JNTUH but still I was tensed because IIIT is an international institution and being a part of these kind of institutions could be a dream for every student. After some time we are called for certificate verification and after completing that there was a presentation in which they provided all the details about the course durationrules and regulationsfee structure and lot more. Then we are asked to attend a face to face interview in which I was asked to selected select the institution in which I want to take the course. I answered “Sir I obviously choose IIIT as it is one of the most reputed institutions”. The interviewer was calm for a few seconds and I am tensed. The next minute I heared a voice saying that “Congratulations mam!You got a seat in IIIT”. When he said that news there are no limits for my happiness and I am very excited. In this way the typical day ended with the happiest news.

48,1,Altruism is a type of behavior in which an animal or a mammal sacrifices for that of others. It is an opposite of selfishness. Individuals performing altruistic acts gain nothing for themselves. Example of altruism among both human and animals is sharing and donating. We may donate our organs to people who are in need. We also share our food with the strangers just because of altruism. Such acts are altruistic since it benefits others. In spite many animals are willing to sacrifice food or even their life for the members of their group. Old age homes education to poor children pet homes etc are the examples of things done by altruists. Altruists expect nothing from others and helps people with having any beneficials. Altruists may or may not be educated but they have kind heart to help others which is the greatest qualification ever. In a simple terminology altruism is unselfishness. Altruism is a part of life. Sharing our energy with other people and showing compassion towards humans and even animals can lead to happiness. It’s like a straightforward bridge from altruism to happiness. Now a days people are busy with their own lives. Every one need their own life and they have no time to spend even with their family. Today's youth is developing at a very faster pace. It is required for everyone to be a self dependent obedient knowledgeable person otherwise it is difficult to stand in such a competitive market. But to have such type of qualities foremost important thing for an adult is to be respectful obedient and firm which can only develop if young adults live with their families for a longer time. However if adults want to live independent then rather than becoming talented they become harsh notorious because in the developing stages it is required for an adult to live under observation of their parents otherwise they will definitely get involved in some bad deeds. To begin with if an adult is young or we can say that in a developing stage then it is required for him to live under observation. This is required because the behavior of an adult in the developing stage changes according to surroundings it is difficult for him to change that behavior in older stages. If in developing stage adults live with their family then they will definitely teach him about obedience. Parents also teach the adult that how to give respect to others. But at the same time if in developing stage adult isolated from their parents then it is difficult for him to understand obedience and it could be a possibility that adult get involved in some bad deeds like drug addiction etc. which makes impossible for an adult to be a self dependent person. In conclusion it is required for young adults to familiarize themselves with the responsibilities they has towards their families which will only occur if they live with parents for longer times. This helps children’s to be an obedient respectful and independent person. It is undeniable that society accepts only obedient and self independent person which indirectly helps in the development of the nation. For example because of many reasons whatever it might be old age homes are becoming the source for many parents. It's not the right way of treating them. When parents become old it is the time when we should take care of them and be a support for them.

48,2,The passage explains about professors. The main concept is about professors appearance on television. Professor the person who teaches at college level. Mostly professors teach in college but they sometimes appear on television. Most of the people says that they appear on television because they have many benefits. They acquires the reputation as authorities with many number of audience than they have at college level. They also says that when professor appears on television their importance is enhanced. Not only the professors the universities also get benefitted by that in case of more donations because of most knowledgeable professor. They also states that professors who are appearing on televisions are mostly to earn money. They make more entertainment that teaching. It is also a time consuming processing because doing rehearsal’s before attending the program and travelling is a loss of time. Instead of doing this they can go for research which is very useful to them. The appearance of a professor in television also became a business for universities since they are earning money.
48,3,Young people enjoy life more than old people do.I agree with the above statement. Firstly I state that if a person have a lovable parents he is he most happiest person and enjoys a lot in his younger stages.Coming to other reasons now a days people are not so efficient as in past due to more amount of unhealthy food consumption in day to day life. In past the quality in food is much better than now a days and the people are very healthy even they become old in those days. But now a days most of the people are becoming old mostly at 60 years of age and so people enjoy their life at their younger stages only.Younger ones are more energetic and active compared to older ones. So young people have more active participation than old people. They actively participate in games and other cultural activities and education is the place where they mostly learn everything and also enjoy their life. Young people also had an active participation in travelling different places and experiencing different types of enjoyments which include games such as rollercoaster water rides gokating car races and many other. In this cases the old people don’t have much interest and they miss their enjoyment.Also young people enjoy their life during their school days and college days. It is the time where they learn lot of things and participate in many things and will have the most memorable days of their life.Finally the main reason for the younger ones to enjoy a lot is friends. Friendship is the greatest gift of god since friends are the one who encourages us and stand by us in difficult situations.So by efficient examples I state that Young people enjoy life more than the old people do.
48,4,Magadheera : In the year 1609 AD Aravali Mountains at a place called Bhairava Kona. The place seems to be a war field after the war ended and the two people at the cliff of a mountain Kaala Bhairava and MithraBinda are seen to be wounded really bad. MithraBinda the queen who is counting her last breaths asks Bhairava to express the love which he had been hiding from her. Then Bhairava the soldier struck by arrows in his chest removes the armor and starts answering MithraBinda. Before he could complete Mithra dies and falls off the cliff. Seeing that Bhairava couldn’t resist and jumps to hold her hand and eventually both die. Then ShareKhan comes and finishes the final rituals for Bhairavas left out armor wishing that Bhairava would come back to prove his love. And then skipping 400 years to the year 2009 AD we see that a person with similar features to Bhairava coming alive. This is actually a very great introduction. In this introduction the director or story writer actually tries to make the people feel very enthusiastic about the story. It was a clear explanation of where the story started and the time when it happened. It also has explains what happens to the characters. From the introduction the audience can understand that the pair loved each other but couldn’t make it possible for some reasons and they die unfortunately. And when ShareKhan says that Bhairava will come back then the story moves 400yrs forward and we find a similar person which gives the hint of incarnation of the same person. The whole introduction makes the audience feel curious and enthusiastic about what happened 400yrs and what is going to happen at that moment.Jalsa : A samurai sword with blood on it gets nailed into the middle of the Road. Then the a voice in the background speaks “In our Country one in a lakh owns a bungalow one in a thousand own a car one in a hundred owns a computer but for every two in ten people own a gun/knife. Which means we have more flexibility to die than to live. My friend once told his kung fu student that ‘Killing the enemy is not what that makes a war meaningful but to…..’”. The voice stops there and says” It would be more meaningful when my friend says it…..meet Mr. Sanjay Sahu”.Then the leading character comes in to the picture. This is an interesting introduction. This introduction has started with giving some facts rather than going directly into the story. Facts actually grab the people’s attention and make them more curious about knowing what is happening. And the voice over that is being heard is well developed framing of words and catchy. And the part where the sword goes down into the ground is quite leaves a question to the audience. And the End the lines the voice over introduces the lead character with the name and tells whose story we are going to deal with. And along with that narrator leaves a question of what the sentence is in the last lines for which the audience will be very interested to know the answer while the movie is going on. 1.If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?I would like to go Kerala the place with serene atmosphere and spectacular views. It is rich in its traditions and culture. I would like to go because it consists of most beautiful places. The Munnar is the place with green landscapes waterfalls lakes and tea plantations which makes us to feel like heaven on earth. And it includes Kumarakom which is famous for bird watchers Thekkady a place with wild life species. Fort Kochi the Gateway of India which attracts us with its architectural and historical sites. Poovar Island where we can see floating cottages and we can enjoy the nature by boating. 2. The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer. The School board should implement a longer school day but it should include both education and extra-curricular activities. The school day should be longer because students need to prepare for higher education. School is the base for every person. If a person had a good grip on all subjects at School he/she can be selected in IIT’s or other best institutions which gives a bright future for an individual. Not only education a person also needs extracurricular activities. He must be good in both. Though a person has a great knowledge and if he/she doesn’t know how to handle the situations it doesn’t seems well. So having longer longer school days should benefit a student in both the aspects.

5,1,TOFEL PRACTICE TEST – 2 (WRITING Task 1)To start with there are many points in the audio lecture which opposes the views in the reading passage. In my view both has their advantages and disadvantages .The main point of the passage and the audio is about the professors appearing on the TV. As discussed in the passage they are useful to both professor and the public. In audio it was told that these activities are not good for professor itself or not much useful for public. I don’t agree with them only to a certain extent. For example consider the online courses given by professor they are very helpful to the students whore are poor and can’t afford to go for the college. They also helps us in watching again and again if we forget something.In addition universities also receive positive publicity which leads to improved reputation for the university and more applications for potential students.However there are also disadvantages to it as it consumes lot of professor’s time in reharsing and travelling. This ultimately leads to loss in spending the time with students and decreased research work. For instance this will be considered as entertainment rather than the education. Sometimes these professors are not invited to important events. To conclude I want to say that there are both advantages and disadvantages for a lecturer in advertising on TV. It mainly depends on the professors how they want to interact and on the people how to effectively use these online resources.TOFEL PRACTICE TEST – 2 (WRITING Task 2)To start with enjoying is an important way of life. The topic is about whether young people enjoy more than old people .I agree with this but there are some situations where young people are less energetic stressful and can’t handle the situation thus losing their lives.Considering the situation of young people who are more energetic than old people show lot of enthusiasm tough completion in situations like jobs education business. For example most of the start up’s today are found by the people below the age of 25. Most of young people take active part in doing social service donate blood and conducting camps on health welfare and considering this as a part of their enjoyment.However there are situation where young people cannot handle the situation wisely and thus losing their lives at an early age. Most of today’s youth are addicted to smoking drinking in the name of enjoyment.On the other hand old people have faced many critical situation in their life and know how tackle the problems according to the situation. This is the stage where they get retired from their work and starts enjoying. But in today’s situations and environment life expectancy of people has greatly decreased and are exposed to different diseases and are less immune to them. For example we see many old people are in constant observation and consumption of medicines throughout their life.To conclude I want to say that young people have more opportunities to enjoy in life than old people however it depends on personnel perspective to do whatever with their life.

5,6,***Mam by mistake i have taken practice test 3 instead of 1*** TASK -1First doubt is about the dress she is wearing though she is wearing the linen cap that only servants wear but the dress she is wearing is of high price that no servant can offer it was explained that the fur collar was painted later. when the colour is erased it is observed that the dress is of normal quality.Next there was a doubt about reflection of light. only the face part is reflecting the light remaining colour was in such a way that it is absorbing the light rather than reflecting it. After the removal of fur paint the entire picture started to glow in light.The final doubt is about the panel on which the painting is done. The painting was drawn on a panel made of several pieces of wood glued together as Rembrandt would never do that. later it was revealed that these pieces are attached to make it look more costlier. It was also known that the wood used for this painting is same as that used for his other paintings.These points made clear that the painting was originally made by Rembrandt. Though it was removed from the official catalog of Rembrandt's paintings in 1930 now it is declared that it belongs to him. TASK-2Friend is one of the important person in our life. He is the one with whom we share our views. In my view it is of equal important to keep our old friends as well as making new friends .To start with there is a saying that a friend in need is a friend in deed .In my view it is true because they are the persons with whom we share most of memories they are the ones who help us when we were in need. we enjoy together. Old friends are those whom we know for a long timethey know very well about us and we too know about them. For instance consider about our childhood friends whom we remember till date. In my view they are most valuable. This does not mean that we should not make new friends.With advancements in Day to day life people are moving to much farther places easily for their work but this is place where we are new and want to look for new friends .For example consider in cases of higher studies we go for foreign countries or when we go for a job there we don't have any known persons in this situation new friends helps us to know about the location. It is very hard to kill the time without friends. A gregarious person will be more enthusiastic than an introverted one.In conclusion i want to reiterate that all friends are important whether they may be old new young boy girl small big. We have to treat them equal.many of us can't go outside without a friend. so a friend is most valuable person in our life.

50,3,After high school I enter the college to be a college student. My first day in BVRIT College was on September 2nd 2011 and it was the first week of the year with full of new expectations. I get into a new college life that was exposed to a different life style in learning and met all new people. As soon as I enter the college campus I thought the high school life was over and a serious time of life began.              By entering I have seen a big parking place I got to feel that I was entering a big institution. I entered the college and started asking people to help me in finding my class. I walked down the main walkway and was amazed at the size of a college library. People were studying with their books. I felt like I had entered a world of study. I walked into a big open place in which contains video games indore sports and chairs. People were eating playing video games and doing their works then soon I understood that it was canteen. Finally I approach a student and he showed me my classroom number in the register book. He told me to follow him because he also studies in same class. I found my seat and sat down. The looks of the classrooms at BVRIT College are awesome and the organization of the classrooms was different from the classrooms in high school. The first-week experience have been filled with too many emotions to recall. Hearing student’s talk about the workload scared the hell out of me. After five days my worries have died down but something embarrassing has just happened which underlying truths to the perceptions that worried me before I left for college.
50,4,Task-1: Humanity in person represents the character. In such a way that altruism is a type of behaviour which forfeits their interests to strangers and family members for their own gain or benefit to others. The person who is acting with the altruism will be rewarded. Even some animals like meerkat may also going to perform altruism for other animals. Some persons may act like they willing to perform this act or they are been help by some other altruism. The people will also act like guard and look for other predators while intend to grab the food or the food which is obtained. These meerkats will make an alarm for intimation to remaining to run and seek shelter and after if they see predator left again intimating to others that feel free. Similar to this if the humanity of a person be in a stability manner then the others will also survive with the altruism. For example if a person helps guy who is in need will willing to be feel free of mind from the next minute.Task-2:Today most of the people vary with one another that to be independent or to stay with parents because of the growth of current humanity and exposure from each other. For some particular reasons like strong rules by parents that which are not be likely for exam one of my friend want to go for outstation and the parents told not to go because of their fear that if anything happens towards their son but the son takes these words as unconstructive and fells like to be independent from parents. Some of them want to be independent because of their needs and for their future scope or because of their harsh reasons from their parents. According to me as I want to stay with my parents because of their care and intension to make me stand by my own in the future. For example as I stayed with my parents since childhood as they gave me a lot and while doing graduation I thought to go for abroad for my higher studies they supported me a lot to g. I make all my arrangements to leave them for my own purpose but when I reconcile all my past I have decided stay here with them and taking care. This example defines how they care about their sons/daughters and decided to they with parents for rest of the life.Thus from above reasons I conclude that it’s better to be stay with parents because of the need in right stage where to go in correct path and even the parents may need in a stage where they feel needy . The young adult mentality may be differ from one to another in such a way that some may want to stay with their parents or some may want to be independent from their parents.

50,9,Writing Task-1As professors giving lecture or any comments on latest events in television will gain some of the knowledge to the public as well as students. By this there are many benefits to the professors as well as to universities. By giving lectures on television professors acquire a huge reputation in academic fields and in campus. If they publish views in academic views only scholars will learn and appreciate views about it. By this even university will receive positive publicities of professors who appear in television. This will lead to get full of reputations donations and more applications from potential students. Mostly television people won’t have contacts with professors either they are experts or else to expose their views. And mostly if the professors appear on TV will be having face because of their knowledge but the remaining professors will be able to avoid in meetings conferences because of pity. By appearing in TV the professors may waste a lot of time in preparing the content from web as well as to expose their views in front of all. This leads to little drawback to them as well as to the universities for wasting a lot time for students and to university.Writing Task-2I strongly agree that young people will enjoy a lot more than old people because of multiple aspects situations thoughts that they will have in current life. But in rare cases even old people will enjoy life sometimes. The young people will have a lot of physical strength remembrance to have fun and be active in all the situations but old people cannot. In some cases the younger people will also have lots of mental tensions and frustrations during their work and leads to lose their enjoyment for some time/day. While coming to old people they no word to do other than take caring of themselves as well as their families and that they feel like enjoyment for the rest of life. For example old people will think about their son/daughter responsibilities that they need in a particular situation they have some fear about the health as well and thoughts would be high by thinking about their grandson or granddaughter all day. This will lead to their mental stress and changes in their health. Even in some situations cannot handle the work that based on their strength and stamina and at the stage of old age they need to more careful about their health other than concentrating on others. Old people should also enjoy in their life because of their handling their children till date. Young people will be in a situation where to know that how to enjoy based on the mood that they have for example young people can roam climb dance eat till their stamina get too low. There are some situations win which both young and old people will enjoy at same time in which at conventions festivals and get-together.Thus based on above reasons I say that young people will enjoy a lot more than old people. But at some constraint the old age will arrive after the young age so I say enjoy should be there where no young and old are considered. “Life is very short so enjoy more”.

51,3,According to the speaker altruism is an unselfish act with which she completely agrees. But she contradicted most of it by valid research.Firstly she contradicted the concept of altruism by a research material of meerkats especially about their eating habits. Even though one of the meerkats acts as a sentinel of the whole group to safeguard the group still there is a chance for the predators to prey on the group. Because the sentinel eat before they stand guard for the whole group and just alarm whenever there is a danger coming. This may lead to miscommunication of the alarm sound as it may refer the group to gather or move quickly where the scope of becoming a prey is more.Secondly the speaker also took an extreme example to prove the adversity of altruism. Here it is if a man donates his kidneys to one of his relatives or to a complete stranger then the question is about will receive any kind of appreciation which is more valuable than the donation?Finally the speaker want to conclude that the even though altruism is a pure concept some of its advantages may also turn into disadvantages in time.
51,4,1.All large software development projects irrespective of application generate alarge amount of associated documentation. For moderately sized systems thedocumentation will probably fill several filing cabinets; for large systems itmay fill several rooms. A high proportion of software process costs is incurredin producing this documentation. Furthermore documentation errors andomissions can lead to errors by end-users and consequent system failures withtheir associated costs and disruption. Therefore managers and softwareengineers should pay as much attention to documentation and its associatedcosts as to the development of the software itself.2. a)Process documentation: These documents record the process ofdevelopment and maintenance. Plans schedules process qualitydocuments and organizational and project standards are processdocumentation.b)Product documentation: This documentation describes the productthat is being developed. System documentation describes the productfrom the point of view of the engineers developing and maintaining thesystem; user documentation provides a product description that isoriented towards system users.3. Effective management requires the process being managed to be visible.Because software is intangible and the software process involves apparentlysimilar cognitive tasks rather than obviously different physical tasks the onlyway this visibility can be achieved is through the use of process documentation.Process documentation falls into a number of categories:1. Plans estimates and schedules: These are documents produced bymanagers which are used to predict and to control the software process.2. Reports: These are documents which report how resources were usedduring the process of development.3. Standards: These are documents which set out how the process is to beimplemented. These may be developed from organizational national orinternational standards.4. Working papers: These are often the principal technicalcommunication documents in a project. They record the ideas andthoughts of the engineers working on the project are interim versionsof product documentation describe implementation strategies and setout problems which have been identified. They often implicitly recordthe rationale for design decisions.5. Memos and electronic mail messages These record the details ofeveryday communications between managers and developmentengineers.4.The major characteristic of process documentation is that most of it becomesoutdated. Plans may be drawn up on a weekly fortnightly or monthly basis.Progress will normally be reported weekly. Memos record thoughts ideas andintentions which change.Although of interest to software historians much of this process information isof little real use after it has gone out of date and there is not normally a needto preserve it after the system has been delivered. However there are someprocess documents that can be useful as the software evolves in response tonew requirements.For example test schedules are of value during software evolution as they actas a basis for re-planning the validation of system changes. Working paperswhich explain the reasons behind design decisions (design rationale) are alsopotentially valuable as they discuss design options and choices made. Access tothis information helps avoid making changes which conflict with these originaldecisions. Ideally of course the design rationale should be extracted from theworking papers and separately maintained. Unfortunately this hardly everhappens.5.Role of working papers: These are often the principal technicalcommunication documents in a project. They record the ideas andthoughts of the engineers working on the project are interim versionsof product documentation describe implementation strategies and setout problems which have been identified. They often implicitly recordthe rationale for design decisions.

51,6,According to the professor in the lecture she made it clear that the idea of professors appearing on television is nowhere benefit to the general public. She explained it by considering and comparing university lectures with television lectures. Firstly professors who are appearing on television may get good reputation in their respective areas. But some of them fetches benefits in it by bombarding themselves in front of their fellow professors. And instead they are wasting their time in just appearing on televisions. They can’t go in-depth about the academic lectures and make the public confused about the topic. Secondly the professor also explains that how some of the research scholars are wasting their time by investing more time in TV lectures. They have to prepare for the lecture and have to travel to the studio to present it. Also to touch-up themselves to look good in front of the camera which involves a lot of time. Instead they can spend the same time for research and helping students in the university. They are also not paid handsomely for this where they can’t even afford for their research. At last the TV networks are making money by these kind of lectures. They only bother about the title of the lecture but not the intellectual content in it. And the public are also not interested in watching hours of academic lectures at dinner time. So it nowhere benefits the public and the professors who participate in the TV lectures. It’s better to educate people by campaigning or expanding schools in every part of the country
53,1,Task 1: Altruism means the opposite of selfishness; individuals performing it gains nothing for themselves.We find altruism in animas like the type of behavior in which an animal’s sacrificing its own interest for that of the animals or groups of animals. Altruism abound booth among human and among other mammalsUnselfish acts among humans range from the sharing of food with strangest strangers. Such acts are altruistic in that they benefit another yet provide little reward to the performing the act.In fact many species of animals appear willing to sacrifice food or even their life to assist other members of their group.The meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa is often cited as a sentinel standing guard and looking out for predators while the other hunt for food or eat food they have obtained. If the sentinel meerkat sees a predator such as a hawk approaching the group it gives an alarm cry alerting the other meerkat’s to run and seek shelter.By standing guard the sentinel meerkat gains nothing it goes without food while the other eats and it places itself in grave danger.After it issues an alarm it has to flee alone which might make it more at risk to a predator since animals in groups are often able to work tighter to fend off a predator.So the altruistic sentinel behavior helps ensure the survival of other members of the meerkat’s group.Task 2:Yes now a days the most young adults want independence from parents as soon as possible. But I don’t like that; I could prefer to live with my families for my life time. Because when in have any most happy situations first persons to share our feeling with our parents and they are the only one how can trust blindly no parent want their child to be in bad situation and they always support to reach our goals and after that also and at last they are the first persons on the world you know.For example when I am on 10th standard I don’t use to study but my parents put me in a good collage that he can do the better in that collage so they have trust on me that I can do the beater and have good feature and good life on that my life change to good and it is first step for my life that was made by my parents very strong. On that I have reached my goals on support of my parents. And I have much experience in my life they support to reach my goals. So I like to be with my parents for my life.

53,12,"Task1:Summarize the points made in the lecture being sure to explain how they oppose specific point made in the reading passage?A:Professors are normally found in university classrooms offices and libraries doing research and lecturing to their students . But now a days we find some professors appear as guest on television programs this give great benefits to the them as will as university also. By this the university will get the benefits but he will loss of ""Time"" .Professors can spend this time in doing research and giving lecturing in class rooms.

Task 2Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ?""Young people enjoy life more than older people do.""A:Some people may think that older people enjoy life more than young people do. However in my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do. Young people passion and energy are enough to enjoy life more than older people do.Firstly the Young people do not have much responsibly when compare to older people. For an example older people have to take care of the their children's and there family this type of responsibly r not on the younger people in the family.Coming to work the young people do their work fast because of energetic and speed and good and invitee thoughts to do work. then older people.Coming to Technology the young people have easy adoptability to new technology then older people.To in finally there is a huge difference between young and older people to enjoy their life. Of course the older people can also enjoy their life according to their new age. They might not feel fully enjoyed life like in their young age. On the other hand young people can able to enjoy life by being less responsible more energetic and more following up new things."

53,6,An Environmentalist and a Photographer meet near a forest in early spring and reminiscing on how things have changed. They both met accidently and started discussing how things have from the past. Environmentalist sees the photographer taking photos of various sections of the forest. The environmentalist goes to the photographer and queries as followsEnvironmentalist: why are you taking these photos?Photographer: hi I am a photographer and i am taking photos publish an article on how forest areas are affected due to deforestation.Environmentalist: Oh! That’s great. It is a very good idea. I am an Environmentalist working under national forest department.They walk together and observe the surroundings of the forest. The conversation goes as followsPhotographer: Have you visited this forest earlier?Environmentalist: yes I have visited this forest five years back before when i was transferred to another city.Photographer: How was this forest at that time?Environmentalist: At that time this forest used to be very dense during spring season all the trees were full of green leaves. Many animals used to live in this forest. But now it has changed a lot. Area under forest has decreased a lot. Many houses are built in the surroundings. Animals have almost disappeared in the forest. Photographer: I have been to this city recently. This is the first time i am visiting this forest. I could observe from the surroundings that this was a forest area. And a large section of it is deforested to build houses which must not be permitted. People need to take permission from the forest department before they take that area. Instead of developing the forest How did they give permission to these many houses? Environmentalist: Previously this was a large forest area. Urbanisation is increasing with time and land is needed to build houses. Initial a small volume of area was given for building the houses. But latter the scenario changed .Many people observed this forest was near to the city and real-estate builders started getting permission from the government and stated selling lands to people. The government has given only a limited part but people started expanding those boundaries and build the houses. Photographer: that is really bad. It affects the lives of many animals and disturbs the ecology. Can’t you take legal actions on this?Environmentalist: yes we can take legal actions but it takes time as no one will be vacating the land easily. Also recently there was a fire in this forest where large section of the forest was cleared and that land is also used for housing.Environmentalist: yes Even after many rules and regulations things are going out of control. This affects our future.Photographer: I feel very lucky to meet you today. You helped me in gathering a lot of information. Thank you.Environmentalist: It was nice meeting you. I could recollect how things have changed from the past .I hope to see the article soon.

54,14,Task 1Professors who are found in university are appearing on television is benefitted to the professors. It was opposed in the audio lecture as it is not good for the professors because it is very time taking procedure for him by taking notes for his presentation rehearsing them and also time that will be taken for his travel. This may also effect on the reputation he has on his fellow colleagues. His fellow professors may think that he is not worth as he doesn't have enough knowledge on the subject but still appearing on television. Because of which he may get difficulty in getting money. The audio lecture also opposes the point on this getting benefitted to the public. The lectures on the television is not grabbing the attention of the viewers as many of the commercials do appear while watching one TV show. The professor may not cover the entire topic by just one single TV show.Task 2As per my view I agree to the statement that young people enjoy more than the old people. Because young people are more energetic and healthy. They can roam wherever they want to and whenever they want to.The young blood is always healthy. Youngsters have zeal to achieve their goals and dreams where as old people might have already achieved their goals and dreams or they haven't but still they must have already lost that ray of hope in achieving them. As they must have seen everything that they came across their life.For example I have a friend Keerthana who has a dream of visiting all the places across the world. She can achieve it only till she is young because as she becomes old her age and her health may not cooperate. But these days youngsters are not having enough time to enjoy. Everyone are getting busy in their own life. In fact they think old people are blessed because they can happily take rest.

54,6,"Dad I want to become a photographer just one line I have to tell my dad. But I am very much scared of how he may react. These thoughts were running on my mind while walking across the streets late at night. I heard a strange sound somewhere behind a tree. I got scared and rushed home but still that sound kept on hissing I decided to go back to the city park. There I have noticed a strange creature.""What are you?"" I asked it. It got scared looking at me for the first time and cried out even more louder. ""Don't worry! I may help you I just want to know what happened to you "" I said with which it could calm. It started making signs by which I came to know it's an alien from outer space. ""Everyone have accused me for what I have never done and decided to leave to some another place and unfortunately I have landed here"" it said.""Do you know your way back home?"" I asked. It answered yes. I felt relieved after listening to it because it would be like koi mil gaya sort of adventure in my life.I took him to my home and comforted him and said"" It's alright But you have made a mistake running away. You should have confessed strongly that you have not done anything wrong. Now it would be like you have admitted your mistake rush back home and win the trust of whom you love the most.""

54,8,TOEFL WRITING TEST TASK 1Altruism is a quality were the people do sacrifice were the people do sacrifice with their own interest and doesn’t expect anything in return.A meerkat which acts as standing guard typically eat before standing as a standing guard.And the sentinel meerkat is most likely to escape as it sees the hunters because it is the first one to see the hunters and the rest of the meerkats doesn’t understand whether to gather or to departure in order to save their lives.Predators are in great danger as they are in their hunt of food.People usually donate organs and blood to their relatives or to the other humans and they would be rewarded for which they had done.TASK 2As per my view on the topic I would prefer both. Intially since its young adult age we might be in a place were only confusion leads our mind.At that period of time we need suggestions from our parents. Think about their opinion and move on.But parents should also be free enough that their children feel free to discuss to what they are going through. And setting them in a right path. A young adult might have many friends but still he will listen to their parent’s voice or opinion.By staying with parents the young adult will never get an individuality to stay some where else because of his work location or for further studies in university which is far from their home town.I have a friend named sahithi she got placed in a multinational company and was posted in Nagpur. Because of which she was supposed to stay far from her parents. She was an only daughter and pampered child. She felt very difficult to stay away from them. As she is most pampered kid there was a lack of individuality and doing few things all by herself. Her parents are free with her and she also shares and takes up their opinions from them because of which she is able to get along though she is staying from them.My opinion is though young adults stay with their parents or away from them they need to have enough individuality and ability to discuss their personal opinions with their parents before making up a conclusion.
54,9,"The human voice it is the most powerful weapon in the world. The word powerful is described for human voice because knowingly or unknowingly we may hurt people with the words we use or the way we say it. The pretty large habits we generally fall into are..Firstly it is gossip which is not a nice habit speaking of something ill about a person though we have no idea whether that person has done it or not but still spreading that to everyone they know. Second one is judging a person we shouldn't judge a person by their looks or their behaviour. Third is negativity is the other form of complaining for everything on everyone. Complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world. Next is Excuses and a blamethrower.Penultimatethe sixth of the sevenembroideryexaggeration it demeans our language. But sometimes exaggeration becomes lying. Finally Dogmatism the confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated you're listening into the wind. Somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. There are four really powerful cornerstones foundations that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world.Fortunatelythese things spell a word. The word is ""hail"" and it has a great definition as well. The H is for honesty being true in what you say being straight and clear. A is for authenticity just being yourself. I is for integrity being your word doing what you say and being somebody people can trust. And L is love it does not mean romantic love but it means wishing people for two reasons. First of all absolute honesty may not be what we want."
55,1,Movie: Raja RaniWhy: This is one of my favourite movies where I have experienced simple and elegant screenplay and calm background. We can cherish each and every scene where we might have expected it to be happening to someone you know and everything in front of you. Well the movie starts with the wedding setup at a church where our hero and heroine were about to get married. It is a typical wedding where our leads aren’t interested in each other however they are compromised to get married. It clearly depicts that each every moment passing by the sadness keep creeping in them. They both experienced the love failure and stand by the philosophy “Love happens only Once” yet fate made them meet to find true love in each other.Movie: Ye Maya ChesaveWhy: This was a trend setter at the time it was released. Basically in Telugu films if a movie was successful all the hype is only for the hero however it completely changed the scenario where we would be loving the characterisation of the heroine. The movie starts with the wedding of our heroine who would be indeed very confused about her decision to get married to someone else other hero. And hero however would take the risk and attend the wedding. He would re-rewind all his memories the first time he saw her to the day he proposed and lots more.My Favourite PlaceWell if I would get a chance to spend some time I would definitely go for Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is basically famous for the white sand beaches and the tropical rainforests. It is famous for its legendary beauty and charm. We will be able to see the most isolated people in this region. We can experience real life where we can cherish the cultural life and also the aquatic life. This place is completely different from the places around us. We can experience the scuba diving the sexiest events of the Andaman Island. It is also famous for the various experiences of the aquatic life where dolphins whales dugongs sea turtles sailfish sea anemones and many more. In order to protect the marine life fishing has been banned from past 4 decades. It is also famous for the barren island the only active volcano in India. This place is a gift of nature and is a proud source of aquatic life.Write why the school day should or should not be longerI am completely against long school days as it effects the children’s innocent life. Where students would be suffering a lot struggling in between their studies and personal life. Everything will in turn hectic that those innocent hearts will not be able to handle the pressure. Well in some or the other time they have to face all the situations so why they have to suffer now? Hence they can’t handle the long study hours at the very tender age. It will definitely affect their mental stability and also it kills their excitement and the energy levels. It increases the study burden for them and also affect their grades.

55,12,Professors on Television:Basically professors intend to spend most of their time in classrooms lecturing their students libraries and in research. If a professor appears on the TV it affects his professional life drastically as he would not be able to manage his lecture session for his students and also research. If a professor is concerned about the public reputation is termed as “Not serious Scholar” and it would affect his research and also not treated well among other scholars. He would not be invited to any of the conferences which plays a key role in his research. He might be acquiring the reputation among the public and turns into a celebrity but it effects his social life where he would be considered with low standards among other scholars. His time meant for research is completely ruined where he would be spending most of his time in getting ready according to the camera focus and turning into someone who he wasn’t before. It also effects the life of hundreds of students where they would be waiting for at least one lecture of him where he would be spending that time in the studio of concerned television network. And the information provided in the television is not valuable as it is not the information collected during the research of the concerned professor but found in some other data base. And it turns into a drastic experience.Essay Writing:Young people enjoy life more than older people do:Yes I definitely agree with the about statement.

They are strong intelligent cherishing each and every moment of their life. They don’t need to take up the responsibility of their old ill parents handle their wife/ husband or take care of their children. If they are supposed handle all the responsibilities they would missing the charm of their life. Yes they have to handle all the responsibilities at some or other point. Before that they need to design their career in the most splendid way however the path they choose is quite radical. They prefer enjoying within them before initiating anything. They can create a friendly ambience anywhere they wanted. They can enjoy even if they are alone or in group of best buddies or even a group of strangers. They can easily build a conversation with a stranger and can be comfortable with them. They are full of life and also attract people towards them. They also paste a smile on their face always which would give the positive vibes to the one opposite to them. When the people turn older they are bundled with responsibilities over their head which would result in missing the smallest moments of life.Hence all I would like to say is love more and cherish every moment of your life and yes you will create magic- Modern success mantra.

55,5,"Character: a homeless childSetting: a city parkTime: late at nightSituation: someone has found or lost something “Life is a mystery box we never know what's there in it""Paul is a 10-year old child living alone on the streets of Mumbai. Neither had someone who would take care of nor proper shelter. He is always referred as a ""homeless child"" rather than with his name. He had a strong urge to study in school and become a doctor. But he never had a chance to go for it. Whenever people see him they might get irked with his appearance or felt pity on him. But all he wanted was love and care. One day as usual after roaming all around the streets nearby he reached his home at the bushes of City Park. He felt solace in those bushes as if someone holding him. He was about to sleep he heard someone was running around shouting ""Dev”. He just got out of the bushes and saw a couple who are worried and crying. He was about to approach them but thought it was not the right time. He was standing in some distance and so that they don't see him but can hear their conversation. He got to hear that they were missing their child who was playing in the park. They were new to the place and don't know about the place clearly. They were searching for him but unable to find him. He imagined the kid's situation however he never wanted him to become a ""homeless child"". So Paul started searching for the kid in each and every corner of the park at last he found him near the cradle lying on the floor. He gently lifted him and started searching for kid's parents. Once he found them and gave them their child they had tears of joy. They appreciated his efforts and thanked him. After hearing the Paul’s story they took him along them and now he is part of their family who has a father mother and sweet brother. Now he is in process of achieving his dreams. May all his dreams come true!!"

Basically we are fed up with the idea of the heavy rush super markets where we hate pushing each other struggling to get the proper goods and long lasting queues for bill payment. As there is an improvement in our technology we are supposed to come up with idea of some special e-commerce super market where we are assured to get good groceries and fresh fruits and vegetables. It is a super market where we can pick the goods and has a hassle free online payment option. This is a latest technology which would be adopted by all the markets and remains like a start brand.This would be one of the innovative ideas of our generation. Expecting a positive reply from you. With regardsHaritha
55,7,SUMMARY OF PASSAGE: AltruismIn audio lecture it is clearly explained about the meerkat species which reside mostly in grassland of Africa. These species reside in burrows which have a danger of being attacked by predators. In the group of meerkat an individual upholds the responsibility of other members in group taking a stand up looking for predators and guarding without food. While the other meerkats hunt their food and eat it. If the guarding meerkat sees a predator approaching their group it gives a alarm cry alerting the other meerkats to run away and protect themselves. By standing the guard and taking up the responsibility of other group members the guard meerkat is not going to obtain anything.Well this kind of behavior is termed as altruism in which an animal sacrifices its own interest for that of another animal or group of animals. It is completely opposite of being selfish and they gain nothing for themselves. It is even absorbed in human beings from willing to help someone in need to sharing the organs. Such acts meant to benefit others but not the one performing them.ESSAY WRITING:Some Young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their family for longer times. Which of these situations do you think is better? As being a part of today’s generation representing myself my choice would be living with my loved parents rather than being always from them. I don’t think it is fair enough to let them live on their own when they need a strong support in path of their life. I would say being with someone who has known you since childhood who can understand a single action of yours is the best thing you would never love to leave. Staying away from them and depositing the money in their accounts is not what they need. In order to carve up your life they forgot their friends. Because of your exams they stopped attending the family functions. They don’t even have a social life because of us. All they knew is their kids without whom they just can’t live. I would say instead of being away from them just stay together where ever you are. We might be busy in carving our lives but what’s bad in living with them. Once they are with us we would take them as our responsibility with happiness. If you have your parents with you all the hectic life turns into something magical where we have our strength by our side always. What’s wrong in having a cup of tea together with your parents and sharing your where abouts mom packing a lunch box for you and in night having your dinner together alas that would be happiest days of all. They gave everything in order to build up our future but not it’s our turn to present a new life for them with all the happiness in world. And the happiness would stay if we are by their side. We should owe to provide bundle of happiness for them in order to erase all the sorrows in the world.

56,1,QUESTION 1:A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie. List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them.Ans)MOVIE TITLE: DOCTOR STRANGE WHY: Doctor Strange is a 2016 American Superhero film which features the Marvel characters of the same name. In the movie Doctor Steven Strange is a cool and confident person who is a neurosurgeon is interested in solving only difficult cases. Dr. Strange meets with a career ending accident and is badly hurt. He finds a place for treatment in Nepal. The opening scene of the movie revolves around the streets of Kathmandu where people learn mystic arts and are trained on how to save the world from other dimension and multi-universe enemies. In the scene Ancient One who protects the three sanctums in London New York and Hong Kong from Kaecilius who was the former student and has escaped with three zealots. This scene was so memorable because it shows how people are trained in Kathmandu and Doctor Strange puts his ego aside and learns the secrets of hidden world mysticism and alternate dimensions. Finally Doctor Strange acts as intermediary between the real world and other universe and protects the universe from the Dark Dimension which is ruled by Dormammu.MOVIE TITLE: M.S DHONI-The Untold Story WHY: M.S DHONI-The Untold Story is a 2016 Indian Biographical film which is based on the life of Indian Cricketer and the current Captain of the Indian National Cricket team Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The opening scene of the movie begins with its screenplay with the world cup final match in the Wankhede Stadium Mumbai where M.S Dhoni is watching the match live on screen. He understands that the situation is critical and decides to take the stand and telling the authorities that he would go to bat if a wicket falls down. He then takes his bat and walks down the stairs leading towards the cricket pitch. He wins the final match and is selected as the captain of the Indian Cricket team. This scene is memorable because it shows that we should be strong enough to take decisions at any time and should face the situation but run away from that. It throws a message that we should never give up. The audience watching the cricket match think that India will not win the match but Dhoni keeps his strength and spirit and proves that self confidence is necessary to attain success. QUESTION 2:1.    Read the following essay prompts and write a suitable introductory paragraph for each of them using the 3 elements of introduction - hook orient readers and key terms:Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?Ans) Everyone has that one dream place which they would like to visit atleast once in their life. Even I have my own dreamland which I would like to visit with my family.I’d like to visit the Vaadhoo beach in Maldives if I got a chance to go on vacation anywhere in the world. I’ve chosen this place because I’ve heard a lot from visitors who travel to this place telling that Natural phenomenon turns the Maldives sea water brighter than milky way. There is a glow in the water which makes the beach look like as if the stars were floating. Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer. Ans) Physical fitness is also important when compared with studies. If students don’t get time to play sports they might feel stressed and under pressure. They cannot concentrate on studies and this may result in a decrease in their academic progress. In Addition to that children who are physically fit are less prone to medical conditions. I think that school day should not be longer and proper schedule should be followed so that students can manage their time properly and spend their time both for studies and sports activities.

56,12,In the lecture it is said that professors have a lot of disadvantages when they appear on the Television. It is not good for the professor itself when he appears on television. Whereas in the reading passage it is mentioned that professors are benefitted when they appear on the television. But in doing so they are losing their own self respect and image in the society. Firstly When a professor appears on the television he might acquire reputation as stated in the passage but he is losing his position. He might not be allowed to attend any important meetings or conferences as the other attendees may think that he is a TV celebrity and likes to entertain than to educate people.Secondly In the lecture we hear that a professor wastes his valuable time when he attends any show or event. The time he takes to prepare for the event the time he takes to travel to the venue the time taken to perform is all waste. Rather he can do a research and educate people instead of entertaining them. But in the passage it is mentioned that when he is on television he gains a lot of publicity and popularity among the people which is wrong. This assumption is false as the people might think in a negative way and stop listening to him further. In doing so he might also lose his chances of getting any research work.It is also a disadvantage for the university as well. In the Passage it is mentioned that university has a lot of advantage when a professor who belongs to that appears on television. University gets a lot of publicity there is an increase in reputation people think that the university is good and there are more number of donations and admissions but it is all proved wrong in the lecture where we come to know how dangerous and critical it is when a college/university professor appears on television. Yes it does have a negative impact. When people see them on television they might think that it is a bad university as the professor is entertaining on the television rather than being on campus and training students. People also think that the professor doesn’t have any knowledge so he is entertaining.Finally we can conclude by saying that professors need to be on campus but not on televisions which can ruin their image and respect in the society.Youngsters have the spirit and enthusiasm of doing whatever they like. When people are at a younger stage they are strong and have a positive attitude towards work i.e “I can”. They never say no to anything. Yes I agree with the statement that young people enjoy more when compare to old people.According to me when people are young they have freedom to go to any place except a few restrictions. Firstly Young people posses a lot of energy when compared to the older ones. Old people might have disabilities and may not be able to walk properly. But young people though they have any problem they can do a lot of activities at a time. When people are young they can move freely in any type of environment and have any roadside food but when they turn old they need to maintain a balanced diet and live in a healthy pollution free environment. They cannot just walk away onto the streets like the young people. Secondly young people don’t have any responsibilities like the old people do. They have the freedom to enjoy their life in the way they want to. Whereas old people have a lot of responsibilities. They have to take care of their children take care of the family members responsibility to control the people around them manage financial issues etc. They also have to work and earn to live. But young people don’t need to earn or work. These all problems are bared by their parents. Old people also have the responsibility of joining their children in schools colleges and get them married when they become grown ups.Young people have more knowledge about what is happening in the world as they are always connected online through internet. They have a lot of technical exposure in contrast to the old people. A 10 year old boy can operate a smart phone without facing any issues but a 30 year old person might feel difficult to operate it. In today’s world young people think in a creative way. The thinking capability of a young person is more when compared to a old person. For example if two persons (one old and one young) are given a task to complete the younger persons perspective will be more creative and detailed than the old person.Young people are open minded and are free to choose from what they have. Whereas old people think a lot to take any decision. For example if a youngster wants to watch a movie he just checks for the available list of movies and books his/her ticket for one. But old person needs to think about his family about the story about his children’s like and dislike and then make a choice out of it. Young people can ride bikes at a faster speed they can play jump travel long distances and do a lot of things with ease. But old people cannot. They are not physically fit.Finally younger people enjoy life more than old people. Younger people have a lot of friends and can make connections easily using social networking sites whereas old people only have to sit idle at home as they don’t have proper knowledge on how to use technology. Young people have no boundary line and enjoy their life to the fullest. Old people are bounded by restrictions and responsibilities. Young people are instilled with the spirit of doing anything. Old people lack that spirit at times but they can also overcome that by thinking in a positive way and having a positive mindset towards life.

He changed his field of interest became a professional photographer and excelled in the field. Once he was at a wedding reception.He was late for the reception by over an hour as the timing was not correct.He had only one camerathe camera fell off the table and broke.The battery went flat and he had no spares.It was late at night and he had to borrow a guest camera.He couldn’t find anyone for help. An important decision needs to be taken.He had no idea what to do with the camera.Bride and Groom were in confusion why the photographer was not clicking any photos.Laterhe made a decision to go and inform the person in-charge regarding the problem he had.

They should be capable of taking right decision. They should have the confidence and courage to face the problems which arise in their life instead of trying to escape from them.
56,7,Writing Task 1The given passage tells us about Altruism which is a type of behaviour in which one kind of species sacrifice their own interest for others.It can be found in both animals and as well as in humans. But in the lecture we hear something which is opposite to what is mentioned in the passage. Firstly In the lecture we encounter the food and eating habits of Meerkats. Meerkats donot show any Altruism. They eat food before Standguard. Sentinel who is the first to see the predator is likely to escape first. But in the passage it is mentioned that when a sentinel sees a predator It gives an alarm which is not true. Other Meerkats are in danger when compared to Sentinel. Secondly In the lecture It is said that Sentinel gives an alarm to alert others but this alarm can also be to call everyone to gather at one place. Other meerkats might think that the alarm is to gather at one place instead to run far away or escape from predator. And as Sentinel is the first to see the predator it can escape first and give alarm and doing so it becomes easy for the predator to catch its prey. But in the passage it is stated that the alarm is to alert others to run and find shelter which is later proved as false in the lecture. Finally Altruism is related to humans. In the passage it is mentioned that humans also show altruism. They donate kidneys to their relatives and also to strangers. But later in the lecture we find something contrast to what is mentioned in the passage. Humans donate kidneys but do the donors gain approval. Does the kidney accept receivers body. Atlast it is said that all of these are non-material rewards which may be valuable for some people.Writing Task 2:In a lifetimetime comes when every indivisual will be a parent of their children.When a baby is bornparents take alot of care of their baby.When the baby grows youngparents teach him/her how to talkwalkeat etc.But some people after they get marriedthey start abusing and insulting their parents and want to stay apart from them.I strongly oppose this and consider that youngsters should live with their parents for a longer time and forever.I truly support this situation. FirstlyI'd like to share a few scenarios in which a child wants to stay far away from their parents.This is common nowadays.People leave their parents for the sake of others.They dont even think about the sacrifices their parents have made for them in order to bring them up.They leave their parents in old-age homes and happily enjoy their life with their families.Sometimes an adult listens to his wife and insults his own parents infront of her which is bad on his part.Parents love their children alot and dont want to leave them.But children when they growupthey are influenced by the bad world and argue with their parents for independence from them.When the parents are out and dont come back home soonthey dont even bother to call them and ask where they are.They take it for granted.But when we look back into our lifewe can see that when a child is out and doesnt come back home earlyhis/her parents are worriedtensed and donot sleep until they see their child back home.The younger adults need to realize this. SecondlyI'd like to share the scenario of the situation in which Children stay along with their parents for longer time.In such a situationboth parents and children care for eachother.Younger adults take a lot of care of their parents.They take them out for lunch/dinner whenever they are free.Celebrate with them on occassions.They are always available for their parents whenever they need them.In case of any emergencythe younger adults get worried about their parents.They pray god to keep their parents safe.They sacrifice their parties/hangouts with friends in order to take their parents to someplace.They donot let their parents to go to long distances all alone.Such people should be as a role model for others who dont take proper care of their parents. FinallyI'd conclude by saying that its a duty of each and every indivisual to take care of their parents.They should never step backwards.They should more considerate towards their parents.They should be against the world and stand always infront of their parents to protect them.Younger adults should be like a shield to their parents.At timesyou should also be harsh with your wife/children if they are aginst your parents.Everyone needs to realize the sacrifices their parents have made in order to help you to achieve our dreams.I hereby support this situation and think that younger adults should live with their families for longer time.

57,12,QUESTION 1:A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie. List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them.MOVIE TITLE: TAKEN 1WHY:In the film “Taken 1” which is released in 2008 is directed by “Pierre Morel” the introduction scene was the 5th birthday of the Maggie Grace (Kim) who is the daughter of the Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson) who is an retired CIA(Central Intelligent Agent). The opening scene is memorable because it shows his love and care towards Kim. In the course of the movie Kim gets kidnapped while she was on a trip to Paris and before the kidnap Bryan Mills calls Kim and he records Kim’s voice. With the help of the recorded voice Bryan Mills uses his skills which he acquired while working as a CIA and saves his estranged daughter.MOVIE TITLE: Chak De IndiaWHY:The film “Chak De India” was directed by “Shimit Amin” and released on 2007. The opening scene was the final match of “World Men’s Hockey Championship” between “Arch Rivals” India and Pakistan. In which India loses to Pakistan with 0-1 margin. After the end of the match Kabir Khan(Shah Rukh Khan) shakes the hands with the Pakistan’s captain as the sports men ship but one of the media channel misunderstands it and publishes it(negatively against Kabir Khan) as if he fixed the match. After that hockey India Federation bans him playing for the country and files a court case against him. Later he coaches the Indian Hockey Women’s team which leads India to win the “Women’s Hockey World Cup”.QUESTION 2:Read the following essay prompts and write a suitable introductory paragraph for each of them using the 3 elements of introduction - hook orient readers and key terms:Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?If I could go on vacation anywhere in the world then I will go to Amarnath cave which is a Hindu shrine located in Jammu and Kashmir. It is one of the 12 Jyotirlinga’s (The Radiant Sign of the Almighty Siva) in India. Since the cave is mostly surrounded by snowy mountains Lingam (one of the forms Lord Siva) or Ice Stalagmite formed inside the cave. People believes it is the cave where Siva explained the secret of life and eternity to his consort Parvathi. The main reason why I want to go to Amarnath because it has no transportation facility. Pilgrims travel on foot either from Srinagar or from Pahalgam with the help of the resident there which take approximately 5 days to reach the cave. It will be challenging to climb the mountainous terrain to see the Ice form of Lord Siva moreover the whole route will be monitored by the military persons due to border security issues with neighbouring countries. The NGO’s will supply the food for the pilgrims and there will be pandals to take the rest during the bad weather conditions the temperature over there some times will dip into minus degree centigrade due to which many pilgrims will with draw from travelling and some people will die.Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer.Every school board should give the equal importance to the study and sports because along with the studies the sports also plays a very crucial role in one’s student life. According to me everyone will not be successful due to studies itself along with the studies sports also need some time in every student life sports should become the part of the students life because sports helps the students to take the decisions quickly wisely and that too correctly. They helps the students to relax from regular burden/studies and they can be physically fit. Leadership qualities decision making skills team work skills can be improved due to the sports. Moreover many sports persons in the world are school or college dropouts (Sachin Tiger woods Messi etc) but they are well reputed and respected in the society. So consideration all the above facts school board should not implement longer school days but instead make sport practices as a part of daily curriculum.

They stood behind me in any situation they encouraged me to reach my goals gave happiness when I’m sad. They cried along with me when I’m I didn’t get the job and when I met with an accident. They supported me throughout my life they gave me food money happiness etc. Because I have grown I’m not supposed to leave my parents alone because they are becoming older I should be with them throughout their old age and respect them throughout my life.They helped me until I stand on my foot from now I want to stand with them until they expire.

They will teach the tradition to my younger generation; they share their experiences to tackle any situation when they are faced in their life.

58,11,I regained my consciousness and realized that my ship has crashed on a planet unknown to me. I remember leaving my planet to save myself from the clutches of death itself. Tears filled my eyes as I recall my wife with a look on satisfaction smeared on her face knowing that I have escaped from the planet. I lost consciousness soon but I will always remember the last thing I saw The inevitable invasion of my planet by the army of Zion. I quickly wiped the tears and started running in the direction of light I could spot from a distance to escape the fires caused by the crash. As the light got closer and closer I could hear loud noises that I have never heard before. I had reached the end of the forest and I was shocked to see that all the creatures of the planet looked exactly like our species. I quickly went up to one of the creatures in order to communicate but it didn’t seem to understand anything. I grabbed a glacial translator from my pocket and used it to attempt communication. I gathered as much information as I could from the creature. I was on a planet called Earth which was inhabited by a dominant species called Humans. The humans were not as upgraded as my kind but they are still a young species that could advance more. My things struck my mind as to how my life could continue on this planet but I was interrupted by a disturbing noise. Suddenly many humans surrounded me and I knew that being caught meant that I would be experimented on. I swiftly took out a bang from my pocket and activated it. Although my attempt to survive was in vain I was glad I tried.

58,2,QUESTION 1:A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie. List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them.The Dark Knight:The movie starts off with a group of robbers driving towards a bank. They show their anger by saying that Joker The guy who planned the heist was not participating. Once the robbery commences the goons start killing other robbers from their group. Spotting this unusual tactic as an opportunity the bank manager takes out a shotgun and starts firing at the robbers. A single robber remains but the manager gets shot. The manager states that the last robber will suffer the same fate as the others and the Joker will kill him too. The robber then takes off his mask revealing that he is the Joker himself. The Joker then places a grenade in the manager’s mouth whose trigger is tied to the back of a bus. He then rides of in the bus with all the money.The reason why it is so memorable is because of the unusual plan laid by the Joker to steal money from a bank. When the Joker reveals himself and rides of in a bus It perfectly shows the characters mentally unstable state of mind.The Dark Knight Rises:The movie begins with a CIA agent capturing three men and transporting them in a plane. He starts asking them about their leader Bane. He tries to make them talk by threatening them but none of them do. When he starts to threaten the second person the third person talks. When the mask is removed it turns out to be Bane. A second plane arrives from which Bane’s accomplices jump down and shoot all the people in the agents plane. Bane then escapes with his accomplices and a nuclear physicist whom he meant to capture by getting caught.I like the opening of this movie because of the graphics shown where one plane is tied to another and dragged. The immense confidence and strength of Bane showing his nature and leadership was clearly shown and Bane himself had an intimidating look which was then carried in throughout the whole movie.

58,4,The lecture is based on the study of altruistic behaviour. Altruism is the sacrifice of one's own intrest for the sake of others It is the opposite of selfishness where people gain nothing but non-material rewards like appreciation and self worth. The study made clear that altruistic acts are performed by both humans and animals. Some humans show altruistic behaviour by sharing food and donating some even donate organs to family members or strangers.Animals have a similar way of showing this behaviour by sharing food and sometimes even sacrifice their life to benefit other members or a group of animals. One example of such behaviour is found in meerkats which belong to the grasslands of africa. In groups of meerkats an individual meerkat acts as a sentinel and keeps a look out for predators like hawks while the other meerkats go foraging.when the sentinel spots a predator it sounds an alarming cry that alerts the other meerkats to hide themselves.Previously it was thought that the sentinel is on a full stomach and is always the one which has the best chance of survival as it is closest to the burrow while the others are scattered through the land but eventually this turned out to be wrong as the sentinel is the last one to hide
58,5,"I think that the preference of young adults to live with their families or not varies from one individual to another based on how they are brought up.If a person feels that he is being constrained by the ""rules"" laid down in their familythey may think that someplace where there are no such rules would be better. Some people always dream of living alone where they can make their own rules and live however they want. There are others who can support themselves without the help of their parentsThis doesnt mean these people hate their parents it is just their belief that they can live life as an able individual without their parents help. Contradictary to this some people prefer to stay close to their familiesNow these people may want to stay because of various reasons such as unemployment or wanting to return the love of their parents who raised them from kids to adults by supporting them financially and easing some burden on their shoulders.People who come from a backward class family have many less options when it comes to living individually but staying with ones parents does not reduce their work and when the parents get older and older the same work tends to become tougher and tougher.I would like to conclude this passage saying that young adults should move out of their family home to experience life as an individual but always take care of ones family because it is the only thing that stays with a person from when one was born untill their death."

58,9,To: sub: Performance ReviewHello Yogesh The MSIT website project is almost at the deployment phase. Eveeryone in the team has worked hard and the result is satifying. It has been observed that your team mates are finding it difficult to work with you as you tend to work by yourself and although indidual work is appreciated team work is essential to complete the project within the deadline. Also the review of the client has not been impressive and when queried upon reveals that there is a miscommunication between you and our client. The client is unsatisfied with your presentation and beleives that the project would take less time to complete if you had a better way of conveying your ideas. I think you ought to be more assertive when presenting your ideas to a client so any further feedbacks of this sort can be avoided. These mistakes are pretty natural in employees who are new to the job and we expect you to improve upon these as soon as possible. Thank You.M. Abdul HadiThe Web development teamCompany.
59,1,Example Set 1: Introductions in EssaysExamples of Good Introduction Paragraphs:Set 1:“On March 4 1849 John Smith was born to Anna Bradcock Smith and James Smith. Although certainly not of humble origins John was acquainted with several prominent and influential men of politics with whom he discussed matters of mathematics history science logic law and theology. Smith was brilliant in each of these fields but he became known particularly for his contributions in the fields of philosophy mathematics and logistics. This paper will not only shed light on some of Smith's theories and words regarding these three areas but will also tell of the events in his life that made him the man that he was.”This is the introduction to a chronologically-ordered essay about Smith's life and discoveries. As such the choice to begin with his date of birth is a good one. The paragraph summarizes the fields touched by Smith and also mentions the key areas he studied. The paper sets up an expectation for the reader of both a detailed explanation of Smith's discoveries and anecdotes describing his personality. The sentence structure is grammatically sound and flows well. Set 2:“Stereotypes abound in today's society. People seem to have an innate compulsion to categorise others into various groups and then to apply rigid and limited descriptions to these groups. There are therefore amongst others stereotypical nationalities and races; stereotypical sexes and sexual orientations and stereotypical classes. And one place where these stereotypes often thrive is in the mass media particularly in the tabloid press and popular television such as in situation comedy. Some for example Hick (1996) claim that this is a harmless phenomenon whereas commentators such as Ealham (1998) point to the possible dangers of obsessive stereotyping in the media. This essay will examine what sociological evidence there is for the process of stereotyping in the mass media and will then go on to analyse the reasons for its occurrence. The final part of the essay will ask how far society's attitudes are in fact shaped by this portrayal of the various kinds of stereotypes.”This is a very good introduction. It's about the right length; gives a little relevant background and context indicating that the writer has thought about what a stereotype is in its broadest interpretation; makes some initial references to sources; and finally focuses precisely on the question showing the reader that it has been fully understood and that it will be answered. Note that the wording of the final part of the introduction is very close to that of the question. If the essay follows in the same vein it should get an excellent mark.Please answer these questions in a separate word document and upload the document on the submission link provided outside this lesson.QUESTION 1:A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie. List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them.Format:MOVIE TITLE:WHY:QUESTION 2:1.    Read the following essay prompts and write a suitable introductory paragraph for each of them using the 3 elements of introduction - hook orient readers and key terms:Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day.

In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer.

59,3,The lecture describes about the Altruism. It is a common behaviour found in humans as well as in animals.it is an act of sacrificing our interest for others.the people here are selfless and perform its but not for there gain The altruism is an act of sharing food to a beggar or stranger to risking their own lives for others.some of best example is you get is of meerkats they live in Africa .they actually act standing guard while others are looking for food or eat food they obtained .they guard them from predator like hawk .while this act they give alaram cry alerting the ither meerkats to run and seek shelter .but during this act it gains nothing i.e. it goes without food while others eat and it places itself in danger.after alaram it has to flee alone which is a risk but other can form a group to fend of predator The lecture conclude that l people who performs altruism will not have any special status or benefit from the society despite in some condition even they have the to risk their life’s for this actSome young want independence from their parents as soon as possible other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time This passage talks about young adults living with their families is better situation to live with the parents or leave them aloneActually its depends upon various factors like their brought up culture by parents or the situation they live in and so on etcSo here i support the condition to live with the family rather living alone.The God has made a chain that it unbreakable say like when the child is born it will be dependent on the parents until and unless they be come to certain age where they are able to live life on their own but until then some families or parents depend on their children because of their age or certain work cannot be done by them so at that time they have to be dependent on their children it is an vice versa .so the above we can say that ultimately it is the nature that choose the people on their role.living as a family has many benefitsWhere as leaving alone are away from those advantages like sharing each and every part of the life .while in bad times they will help each other and at goodtime they enjoy most but for they people who live alone it will to be hard to find relatives or friend who will be always with you but in families they are always with you But when you should live with family but don’t depend on them always instead of living depending on families always at that situation its better to live alone in this caseBut if you are not dependent then living with our own family is the best option an most of them also should prefer this as it also help the country to be poverty free etcFrom the above we can conclude the best option for young adults is prefer to live with their families for a longer time

59,7,The professor discusses the topic of professors' appearance on TV. She is strongly against this kind of behaviour and at the same time she opposes the points given in the reading. She supports her opinion with three examples. First the professor claims that when a praised professor shows up in a TV programme his situation as a scholar may get worse because such person would appear as a celebrity wanting to be in a spotlight. This may cause fewer and fewer invitations to the academic conferences and even financial support for his research may be declined. This goes against the passage which stated that since so many people watch television by visiting the TV programmes an academic person may obtain a respect among wider auditorium. Second the professor says that going to TV programmes is just a waste of time. Teachers should spend their time on campus since they are hired by the university. If the instructor spends his time in TV studio it is obvious that he is not available for students who may need him. This way students' interests suffer. This again refutes the article which said that actually university benefits from professor appearance in TV because more people will be familiar with the famous name and therefore more students will apply for this particular university. Third the lecturer thinks that TV channel does not benefit from inviting an acclaimed scholar. Television is nothing but entertainment and viewers are not interested in deep insight to the topic. That is way professors usually gives just a brief speech on some topics. This is a counterargument to the passage which showed that people benefit form professor's appearance since most of the viewers have no contact with a university’s person they can get opinions from professionals.  These are the main negative aspects of professor’s appearance on TV given by the professor in her lecture. Neither professor nor university or television benefits from it.Young people enjoy life than old people doIn my opinion to enjoy life age should not be a barrier young or old does not matter. Everyone has their own way of enjoying life. Young people have lot of energy and money to spend but they are usually short of time with their busy schedule of office work family and building their career.On the other hand older people although they are little short of energy but they have lot of time and life experiences to understand the value of even the most simplest things in life. Most of the older people are retired from work and they prefer to spend their time on things which they enjoy. They utilize their time by spending on the things they like hobbies they were longing for since young age spending time with their friends family and their grand-children. For instance my grand-father was very busy in his young age as he has too look after his business had to attend lot of business meetings. He had very little time to spend to go out on vacations or to spend with family. But after retirement he used to to spend most of his time with his friends playing golf exploring new places and spend time with family.While on the other hand younger people are busy with their work life which is getting very stressful in this competitive world. So young individuals do not get much time to spend on stress free vacations or with family.Senior citizens seems to enjoy simpler things so much easier than young people do. Older people enjoy just sitting with their friends and having a cup of coffee. They just seem to appreciate being alive and being able to see the people they are. On the other hand young people do not truly appreciate what they have till they experience some hardships in their lives. In conclusion older people enjoy life with more spirit and happiness as compared to younger people.

6,5,CREATIVE WRITING ASSIGNMENTCharacter – A college studentSetting – An expensive restaurantTime – Sometime in DecemberSituation – Someone’s pride has been injured A frigid North- westerly wind blew over the city which was nestled in the mountains. Decembers in that area were usually cool but this year it was colder. Jayesh chalked it up to climate change as he hurried down the steps of his college library. He was late for a meeting with his friends. Well it wasn’t really a meeting – his friend Vamsi was recruited by Amazon and he was throwing a party to celebrate the occasion. If only I made it through he thought wistfully as he recollected his Amazon interview. Anyway the past was past and he decided not to dwell on it. He walked towards his destination expertly navigating through traffic with ease. Four years of living in the city made it almost involuntary. This was not always the case. He remembered being overwhelmed by the city and its hectic pace when he first enrolled in his college. Though he visited the city before it was the first time he had to stay there for an extended period of time. His thoughts then turned to his village and his parents. He almost missed the restaurant in his reverie. He laughed at that as the restaurant was difficult to miss in the busiest of days. There is only one word to describe it he thought – ostentatious. He felt relieved that he failed his Amazon interview – there was no way he could afford to throw a party here! As he walked towards the entrance of the restaurant he began searching for his friends. When he didn’t see them he assumed they were already inside. He dialled Vamsi and realised that he was out of mobile balance. He continued walking towards the door when he was confronted by a scary looking valet.“Where are you going?” he thundered.“I am going inside. My friends are waiting for me” Jayesh replied in confusion.The valet looked him over dubiously. Blood rushed to Jayesh’s face. It was true that he was looking shabby when compared to the other clientele but it was his best set of clothes! “Yeah right!” the valet said mockingly “I’ve never heard that before!” By this time Jayesh was fuming inside. He tried to reason with the valet but to no avail. In frustration he tried to push past the valet. The valet who was bigger than Jayesh easily overwhelmed him and threw him to the curb. People started to gather around observing the ruckus. Jayesh felt utterly humiliated and alone. Slowly his pain turned to rage. He gradually found his feet and looked at the valet who was sneering at him. He vowed to himself that one day he would avenge this humiliation. He turned around and started walking. He ignored the cold wind the ringing of his phone and the stares of the passers-by and kept on walking till he reached his room. “And that was the incident that made me what I am today” he told his grand-children gathered around him in the same restaurant where he was humiliated all those years ago. Only now he owned it.

6,7,Write an email to your team member on his performance appraisal. He has just gone on project deployment and physically not available with you in the office but working elsewhere and hence you choose to write to him. Following are the points to mention in the email:1. You are disappointed with his team skills and need to give a feedback on that.2. His rating on presentation skills by client has not been that impressive and so feedback needs to be given.3. His biggest drawback is lack of assertiveness and needs to be given feedback on that aspect as well. Try to be professional at the same time try to give the right feedback so that he can improve on those skills.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------To: Kiran@bridge.comSubject: Performance AppraisalDear Kiran I hope the project deployment is coming along fine. I have heard from the client that you are doing a satisfactory job. Now let me jump right into the purpose of this email. It is to give you feedback on your performance and to point out areas that you need to work on. Let me begin by saying that you have prodigious technical skills. There is no doubt in that. However the success of a project doesn’t depend on the technical skills of an individual member. It depends on the effectiveness of a team as a whole. I felt that you were lacking in this area. As I mentioned previously the client feels that you are doing a satisfactory job. However I feel that for a person with your capabilities that is not good enough. I believe the reason behind that assessment to be your presentation skills. So please work on them. Finally from what I observe you are not confrontational. You’d rather spend your time working than debating. Though it is commendable I’ve noticed that you don’t assert yourself even when it is necessary. Assertive communication is essential for inter-personal skills which are necessary to function in a team. I hope you take this appraisal positively and work towards improving yourself. All the best!Thanks and RegardsA.Sai ChaitanyaTeam LeadBridge Software Ltd.Phone No.: +919912196938Email: saichaitanya.akella@gmail.com
6,8,Summary:The following points were made in the lecture that contrast the points made in the passage: A new scientific study revealed some interesting facts about a previously documented behaviour of Meerkats. According to the study a Meerkat that stands sentinel while other Meerkats search for food does so after it eats. This is opposite to the view point expressed in the reading passage which can imply that the sentinel is going without food.The next point the lecturer says is that since the sentinel is the first to see the predator it has a better chance of survival when compared to the other meerkats in the group foraging for food. This opposes the point made in the passage which tries to imply that the sentinel is at maximum risk.Another interesting point is made with regards to the behaviour of sentinel. The lecturer cites some studies which show that the act of the sentinel raising the alarm actually diverts the predator's attention from the sentinel. It instead focuses the predator's attention towards the other animals in the group. The lecture ends by offering some counter-points to the altruistic behaviour of humans. The lecturer discusses the extreme case of a person donating his kidney. She says that such an act is not completely selfless and has some motives. She lists approval and appreciation by other humans and a feeling of self-worth in the donor as some motivations.Essay: In my opinion young adults should be independent from their parents but with some exceptions. The age between teenage and adulthood is young adulthood. It might not be an exaggeration to say that it is perhaps the most critical time in a human's life. It is the age which can define someone for the rest of their lives. What we do during our young adulthood can have a far-reaching impact in our life. If we compare the teenage years of one's life to a cinema the young adulthood can be compared to the climax. It is the period where everything we learnt during our childhood and teenage years comes to fruition. It is a period of great flux. It is important that the young adults be given the independence to take their own decisions. By taking their own decisions they become responsible for their own future. For some parents letting go of their children can be hard but they must realize that by denying their children their independence they are only holding them back.The young adults can learn a lot if given the independence which will give them an edge over their peers in their careers. Parents must realize that teenage years are like riding a bicycle with training wheels on. When they enter the young adulthood the training wheels must be removed otherwise they can become a permanent crutch which their children will have to depend on. The other side of the argument is that since it is such a critical age the children should not be left with proper supervision. It is certainly valid. The young adults have to face a lot of stress not only related to their lives but also related to their careers. When faced with so much stress and so many expectations they may develop bad habits and go down the wrong path. Also if their peers are a bad influence then they can damage their future in bad company if constant adult supervision is not present. However valid the previous arguments may be they can't counter the advantages of having independence. So I believe that young adults wanting their independence should be allowed to have it. However moderation is required. There must be some means for their parents or well-wishers to monitor at least certain aspects of their life. They must be made accountable for their lives. Freedom without accountability will lead to disaster.

I am very happy to join in this College. My mind was similar to a question bank. Everything is new to me.Basically I was new to this environment. The first one I have noticed is heavy work load that I had never experienced before. It was quite similar to corporate actually. Because of this heavy burden on me I experienced loneliness pressure. There were endless nights of studying and writing. I was making many new friends but the major issue was to make friends only of my kind and finding a good friend is a big task to me.Believe it or not your college friends will be among the most satisfying and long-term of your life. It’s always exciting to discover how wonderfully diverse college relationships can be.I usually aim high and work hard to achieve my goal. I have started working on my aim to succeed in my life. I used to wake up early in the morning and rush to college for attendance. That was very funny but because of that I have changed my morning timetable. I felt it was very hectic schedule on that day. It was new to me that staying in hostel without mom and dad.Stepping into MSIT on first day was my typical day but now I am habituated to the curriculums and difficulties of clearing exams here...
61,1,N.ARUN KUMAR- IH201685061Format:MOVIE TITLE: Siva (1989 telugu film)WHY? The movie starts off with a serious scene showing a Rowdy and his gang beating a couple of students and the background music given by Ilayaraja was mindblowing. The scene ends with a car starting and from the smoke the titles appear with a back ground music. The speciality of the movie title is if you look at the movie posters before the release they all have a standard template with Yellow color font. Siva is the first movie to change that with a Red Font and the title has been designed by Teja (Chitram movie Director). The story behind this title is when Teja designed this title and sent it for printing the printing employees rejected it and asked to send it back in standard Yellow font. Knowing this RGV asked Teja “What do you want to do?.” Teja was so confident and said on the lines which meant “Sir do you want to make a routine movie as others or do you want to do something different?” The printing employees had nothing to do but create a new template specially for Siva title.MOVIE TITLE: Brindavanam (2010 telugu film)WHY? A typical cinema hero introduction scene always shows a high voltage action episode and the energy levels involved in it. The fans go crazy over their favorite hero’s entrance scene and brindavanam movie has the best introduction scene in the year 2010. The movie starts with a fight scene where hero saves his friends life from the goons and helps them. The fight scene composition was awesome and screenplay was superb. Watch the brilliance of director in the screenplay the scene starts off by focusing bats and other weapons and then shows hero. The mass image of hero in that scene elevates his heroism and the punch dialogues in that scene were amazing. Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?If I could go on vacation anywhere in the world then I would visit Chardham yatra. Chardham are the names of four pilgrimage sites in India that are widely valued by Hindus. It comprises Badrinath Dwarka Puri and Rameswaram. It is considered highly sacred by Hindus to visit Char Dham during one's lifetime. It is one of the finest yatra in all over world. The direct special buses for Chardham also available nowadays and route is good roads are well maintained by the government now and roads well connected to the major parts of the other holy regions such as temples ponds Lakes River falls etc. Time is mostly the morning cause it beliefs that the Pilgrimage journey should be started in the beginning of the day. Approximately 10 days required to complete the holy journey. The Best time during yatra will be when visiting to haridwar Barkot Uttarkashi Almora etc are the major places to visit. The Chardham yatra is on at the moment with thousands of people visiting the four dhams everyday. So you can too. If you are worried about the natural disasters or getting stuck in the mountains then it would be better if you plan your trip in October when there is less crowd the weather is beautiful and the mountains absolutely impressive and grassy after the rains.Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer.Implementing a longer school days are not beneficial. Teachers and students want a better school day not a longer one and quantity does not produce quality. Therefore extending the school day will not produce a huge increase in learning. We already know that most of the children in schools today resent a longer school day. Concerns for the children are important. Students who experience frequent changes in their school day length's experience distress which can lead to emotional problems and behavioral problems issues. These changes most affect students with prior behavioral problems and learning disabilities.The more time kids spend in school the less time they'll have outside of school. This is time they currently spend on extracurricular activities of their choice. Students will spend time in a basic physical education class instead of dance karate or listening to music. Children already spend a large portion of their day being told what to do how to do it and what rules to follow and have little free time as it is. The ability to make their own decisions on how to spend their time is a learning experience too.If the teaching methods used currently aren't working spending more time using those same methods isn't going to change anything. Quality time is better than the quantity of time spent. Before deciding to extend the school day consider changes that can be included to solve the specific issues the school is facing.

61,11,N.ARUN KUMAR-IH201685061 Young people enjoy life more than older people do People may think that older people enjoy life more than young people do. According to my opinion young people enjoy life more happily than older people do. Their passion enthusiasm and energy are much enough to enjoy life. They have bright future challenging tasks in life and have goals to achieve success in their life. Young people have more ways to enjoy their life than older do because of new technology gives the young people to develop more ways and enjoy. With the available of new technology they have more different ways to enjoy their life and make good decisions in life. For example internet is the best technology which is very popular and common among young people which is not common among older people. Young people have stronger body and more energy than older people. They can travel anywhere visit tourism places can do rock climbing. They can race cars run faster can travel easily which is not possible for older peoples. They have more challenges to face in life which leads them to success and live life happily. Finally there is a huge difference between young and older people to enjoy their life. Older people can also enjoy their life according to their age. Older people feel they are not able to do everything which they want and feel boundary surrounding them.

They are not only found in universities but also appear as guests on television news programs by giving their lecture commentary on latest events in the world. Sometimes these television appearances are of great benefits and drawbacks to them as well as to their universities and students.ADVANTAGES:Professors benefit from appearing on television because they acquire reputations as authorities in their academic fields among a much wider audience than they have on campus.If he publishes views in an academic journal only scholars can learn about it but when he appears on television thousands of people can become aware of his ideas.When professor shares his ideas in television news program his importance as scholars is enhanced.Not only it benefits to professor but also to universities as they receive positive publicity when their professors appear on TV which in turn leads to an improved reputation for the university and gets more donations for the university and more applications from potential students. DISADVANTAGES:People mostly watch entertainment in TV but not depth lecture which leads to decrease in views of lecturing programs in TV.It also wastes professor’s time travel time his makeup time for appearance and has to prepare for presentation in depth.It also disturbs professors meeting with students and also give rise to problems for universities and studentsTV audience mostly don’t encourage watching depth lecture which leads to wastage of professor’s time and preparation..

62,1,Professors who are working in the universities are not only teaches their students but they also spread knowledge through TV programs. By appearing in TV programs professors gain attention of people and it is also best source for them to increase their fame. This TV programs not only brings fame to professor but also it brings fame to the university. People can gain knowledge by listening to their lectures; they can even learn the thing they didn’t hear about. By these TV programs people who don’t know about universities thinks about the University of the Professor. So it can increase the admissions and donations to the college. On the other hand if we keep these advantages aside there are few members who oppose this type of shows. Because they say that these professors are just trying to increase their fame. In order to deliver a show a professor must prepare for that and he should do rehearsals for the program. The professors also need to maintain his attire as he is going to perform in a live TV shows. Instead of keeping their time in preparing for lecture they can use that time in university to teach his students. By considering positives and opposes statements from people about TV lectures my opinion is that we have to research about the topic we are going to listen so that we can differentiate between informative and non-informative lectures.

64,1,The lecture is about the study on altruism among different species like meerkat's and also the compared to human's and other animals. Basically altruism can be defined as a behavior where one sacrifices own interests for the sake of others without any hesitation. To say simply it is the opposite of selfishness. The best example for the altruism is the behavior of the meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in barrows in grassland areas of Africa. Recent studies stated that they have a close behavior among them selves. The sentinel among the meerkat will only eat before going to guard. Others may go for hunting but standing guard will only guards. It issues alarm when there is a danger or to get gathered among themselves. The standing guard will be always in the front when there is a danger and protects other meerkat's. Meerkat's even share their food among themselves. Some of the altruism among human's are like donations sharing either with the relative or with a stranger. By having altruism behavior and do all the unselfishness things doesn't going to provide more respect or any money. Their is no expectation for any appreciation or any rewards provided for this. More over many species like animals will sacrifice their food and some even their life to assist other members of their group. Thus altruistic sentinel behavior helps ensure the survival of other members of the meerkat's group and also among other species.

64,15,Task-1:Now-a-days there are many shows on television where a professor of some university or any college discusses about some points based on subject or about their university etc. This process may be useful to the university for some constant but when coming to professor we can’t say it is it will be useful for him/her to.To say about the benefits of that professor he may get fame as a great expert and can improve the university standard. The university can receive more funds and many students try to apply for that university.He will be loosing the time like rehearsing about what to say on television getting ready for television show more over the show time which he could use for doing some research.

64,2,QUESTION 1:MOVIE TITLE: Mission: Impossible – Rogue NationWHY: Who doesn’t like action movies? Most of them are fascinated about them. Among many movies ‘Mission Impossible’ is one of the top action spy film. As of now they released five instalments of the movie. Among them ‘Rogue Nation’ is the last. “Tom Cruise” plays the lead character in this movie. To say about the Introduction the introduction scene gives goose bumps because of the action stunts that are performed by Tom Cruise. At the beginning of the movie Tom Cruise team tries to stop a plane but they couldn’t stop it. There comes Tom Cruise. He jumps on to the running plane and tries to stop it. But as he was late he couldn’t enter the plane quickly. Those stunts are really awesome to watch on screen rather than to describe them. MOVIE TITLE : Doctor StrangeWHY : It is an American superhero film produced by Marvel Studios. In this movie the introduction scene was so curious that I had been thinking what’s going to happen next? The fighting scene on the moving and falling walls dragged me down out of my chair. I was in a suspense mode and more interested to watch the next scene without any disturbance. Those illusions in the movie made my mind to watch it with more anxiety. Moreover every scene in the movie was awesome.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------QUESTION 2:Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why? If I choose to go on a vacation I would probably choose ‘Dubai’- which is one among the rich places to live. There are many attractive tourist places where we can go and enjoy a lot. There is a skyscraper called “Burj Khalifa” and it is the tallest in the world. Another one is the big Fountain which is amazing. There are also malls named “The Dubai Mall” and “Mall of the Emirates.” And also there is a museum called “Dubai Museum”. In addition to these there is an island called “Palm Island” which looks so beautiful from the sky. Apart from these there are many to watch and recently they are constructing a “Disney Land” and an “Adventure Land” to attract more tourists.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer.Education plays an important role in every one’s life. It doesn’t matter if they implement longer school day or any other stuff. It doesn’t work. At the early age children tend to play more and it is good for their health too. If they implement longer hours they can make them to sit for longer hours and may be teachers can prepare students for their higher education but children need to take rest. In spite of taking long hours just make train how to learn new things. Encourage them in learning their personal skills. Allow them to play more. This would increase their activeness and they can be smart. Because “Today’s children are tomorrows citizens.” It is better to decide according to their capacity but not to directly decide to implement long hours.

(5) First student writers can look for ideas from other people’s experiences. (6) For another thing writers can interview other students or even family members. (7) As one can see a writer may have heard others talk about this topic maybe in class. (8) Second source would be television shows on the topic of communication. (9) Finally college writers may find that they need to do some research to complete an assignment. (10) For instance lots of experts have written articles or books on the topic of communication skills. (11) In addition a search of “communication skills” on the internet might provide useful information; (12) moreover reference librarians can help students find research materials in special collections or databases. (13) On the whole college writers need to be able to draw on a combination of personal experience observations of others and research materials to develop their written assignments.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Major ideas:  Examples:  Additional examples: Conclusions: all in all

64,7,Among all my friends Ram is my best friend. We met each other four years ago in my cousin's birthday party. First time when I saw him I didn't like him much but after meeting him for couple of times I began to like him as he was kind and have good helping nature. Though he is not a good player he likes to play games. He loves to visit new places. Whenever he is angry he doesn't fight or show his anger on others. He just keeps calm and do his work silently. Apart from all these there is a lot to say about him. But to say simply he is a good loving person. Father mother brother sister and relatives are given by god but friend is the only one whom we choose. Thus I feel lucky to a have such a good person Ram as my best friend.   People around globe are busy with their works whereas I’m busy in my college as a student. My day in the college begins at 08:30 am. Every morning when I come to class I decide to study seriously. But sometimes as the time passes I continue to waste it by doing unnecessary work. To be clear in the morning after coming to lab I will practice GAMA which is a part of our academic topics. After completing it I work on IT. At 10’o clock I go for a break for around 30 minutes. After returning it would take some time for me to start practicing those IT programs. I will continue till our lunch time. At 12:30 pm I happily shut down my system and move for lunch. After having lunch if there is time I will chit chat with my friends until lunch time is finished.After coming from lunch my IT batting begins where I keep on practicing and developing new programs to perform well in our exams. In the afternoon from 3’o clock to 4’clock I will attend soft skill session. After completing the soft skill session I’ll go for a break and have some snacks. After returning from break again I continue with my IT work up to 6’0 clock in the evening. In between whenever I feel stressed I take a nap or listen to songs or watch movies in online. After 6 pm if there is any soft skill or IT task to do I will complete that go to play for some time or leave to my room. After that I will have my dinner and go to sleep else if interested I will study for some time or chit chat with my friends.

Up to me it has one of the best opening that have ever saw. It starts in this way a group of atheist entered in to the stadium who are ready to race in Rome Olympics 1960 the commentators were speaking about the greatness of Milkha Singh. In the mean while race got started and Milkha Singh was much ahead of all the athletes on the track but in a sudden he turned back due to some unknown past experiences drawn my curiosity to towards the movie. Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?They are so many world-famous destinations where people want to visit on their vacation like Paris Bangkok United States and many. But I would like to go to all Jyotirlingas present at several places in India.They are 12 Jyotirlingas present in India they are Somnath(Gujarat) Mallikarjuna Swami(Srisailam) Mahakaleshwar (Madhya Pradesh) Omkareshwar (Madya Pradesh) Kedharnath(Uttarakhand) Bhimashankar(Maharashtra) Kashi Vishwanath (Uttar Pradesh) Trimbakeshwar(Maharashtra) Nageshwara(Gujarat) Vaidyanath(Jharkhand) Rameshwar(Tamilnadu) Grishneshwar(Maharashtra).They Draw my curiosity because there was a saying that the god itself originated at that place by taking different manifestos.They are so many temples all over the world but these temples got their unique importance because of the faith by the people and the other side is they are located in the locations which draw the attentions of the pilgrims and make them feel peaceful.So I will like to go to all the jyotirlingas in my life time in order to get some refreshment and to get some inner peace. I will also recommend people to do so even if they don’t believe they can enjoy the environment over there. Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day.

In this I would like to discuss about the pros and cons of implementing a longer school day.I don’t want to support these longer school days because this is the age where they play and learn in an enjoyable way. If there is any imbalance in their studies and playing students can’t digest it which makes them anti towards studies alsoEven sports play a major role in student’s life because according to studies they increase more concentration in the students which in turn help the studies to study with higher concentration by which they can study amore in less time.Researches proved that students cannot concentrate on their studies for long hours. It is also proved that better results can be achieved by engaging them in extracurricular activities.So I would Strongly Recommend not to increase the timing of school.

65,11,Importance of Television Lectures by ProfessorsThe article says about the importance of television to the professors university as well as to the general public and show cases three reasons to support. Anyhow the author says that the common people are the group how get more advantage from such types of shows.At First the readings say that professors are most beneficious among the three since they acquire reputation in their academic fields by appearing on television. But the author states that professors who appear on television are entertainers rather than scholars.Second the article says that universities benefit much from such sort of appearances. However the professors think the that is not that much beneficial to their university. Professors think that those television shows are time wasting for them because they need to keep their work aside and prepare their content for the show. They think that that time can be spent on educating students or by doing research.Third one is the reading says that the public gains more from professors’ TV appearance. But they are so many people against it and they say that television networks never want academic lectures. They keep on titles but there will not be any intellectual substances.Young people enjoy life more than older people In the first place the younger people will have so many options to enjoy their life when compared to older people. Because the world of the older people is very less. For Example Younger people play games online surf next see movies watch YouTube and many more. But these all things are not done by older people. Younger people can go where ever they want and do whatever they want. Younger people have more different choices to make. The young generation can make their life’s much more convenient with the help of Technology.Secondly the young have very much limitations to enjoy their life because they are young they can perform various activities such as paragliding rock climbing without any hesitation because they are fit enough to do such sort of things. Whereas the people in old age can find these things much interesting because they don’t have that much of energy and wish to do all those things and even if they are almost fit they never try to take riskIn the third place the younger people are much energetic less sophisticated than the older people. Because the younger people are much more flexible which makes them fit through their life. Whereas older people draws their conclusion from their waste experience by which they end up with routine ideas. Whereas younger people always try everything to be creative and new in order to enjoy their life up to maximum extent. The younger generations never take care of the future happenings and spend their life very happily. Whereas the older people thinks about their future and they never enjoy even if they have enough wealth to do that. Finally what I want to conclude is definitely the young enjoy their life much more than the older people.

Happy New Year Sir. I am happy to say that we are the leading cab providers throughout India. Our Strategies are the Best Strategies in present market. Our competitive prices are the main reason for getting our customers for our Organization.Now a days I came to know that people are much more interested in taking a pool ride instead of take a cab for them when they are travelling alone by the data that I have received from our previous bookings of last year.

Put yourself in your friend’s shoes and write a paragraph about yourself from his point of view.Up to me what my best friend thinks about me is I am a person who can’t understand the inner meanings of the people. I just believe what I see i.e. I can’t understand their cruel thoughts of the other people who are trying to cheat on me. He might also think that I can’t think in anger and I speak so much in anger. He might also think that I am quite adjustable person and I can adjust in any situation.

65,6,Rembrandt is one of the famous painters from Dutch in 17th century. They are so many paintings of his remembrance. But there was one painting of a lady which didn't matched his style of painting. There are three major reasons to say that it is not the painting drawn by him. They areThe lady in that picture wore a white linen cap which even servants can afford. But her dress color was made of luxurious fur and Rembrandt will never make a mistake at the selection of dresses. After some experiments scientist came to know that the color was again repainted after 100 years of when it was painted.The second reason is because of original white linen can her face was portrayed bit brighter than what it used to be when she wears dark fur color and it was proved that it was painted after 100 years And the third one is that the painter always use a single large piece of wood to portrait his paintings. But that painting has additional wooden pieces glued which Rembrandt never did.By the above three conclusions they excluded that painting out of this remembrance collection.Essay:I think that having friends is the most valuable asset that one can have. Making friends is a good habit but having presence in their life is also an important aspect. Always give your friends the importance what they need to get .By so many instances which i came through i got to know that they are so many people who make just acquisitions for any future purposes. But in olden days friends were used to be like own relatives they share all their views they share their grievance and be like family members and know a days the people are more attracted towards having friends for two purposes they are one is to know as many people for prestige and the other reason is to make use of them when they want them. Up to me making friends matters but having good quality friend’s matters. So spend your free time with them make precious time count with them. Even when we get older the people who make acquisition with us will always expect something from us. So when we are in tender age the friends who are with us will never expect anything for us in return. So building bonds with older friends will make the relation much stronger rather than making new acquisitions those who always seek something from us for their benefit.So try to build relations with the people who always want to be with you and care for you and take your responsibility. They are so many situations where people have so many people where they have so many friends and don’t have good friends. So up to Search for the people who really care for you and who will be with you in harder times and make much more relations with the people whom you used to spend good times and build the relations because relations matters in everyone life rather than anything

66,1,"QUESTION 1:A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie. List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them. Format:MOVIE TITLE: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone WHY: The movie starts with a small boyliving in pathetic conditions.He was not treated well by his uncleaunt and cousin after his mother and father went to the heaven abode.Hesuddenlygets some magical powers and is able to revolt back against them.Magic is surely an escape.Althoughwe know that its not reasonable and pragmatic to have mystical powersbut the fact that an ordinary boy having magical powers and fighting back against the evil wrongdoings towards him moved me a lot.It displayed that we all have strength to overcome the malicious intentions of others.MOVIE TITLE: The Fault in Our Stars WHY: The movie starts with a girl suffering from cancer sharing her daily drudgery details.I got inspired from her the very moment I heard about her story.We all face some problems in life and think that we are the only ones who are unlucky enough to sail in the sea of misfortunes.Butas compared to this girl's(Hazel's) problemsour problems are negligible.She was extremely optimistic and never lose hope to live.Q. The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer.A famous saying goes like this : ""Excess of everything is bad"".Nowadaysstudents studying in high school are already too much pressurized to get good scores.Parentalpeer and teacher pressure haunts them all day long.In such a stressful scenarioit beomes difficult for a student to perform at the best of his abilities.As if this wasn't alone;the school board is considering implementing a longer school day.The problem will be rather compounded by this action instead of alieviating their misery.Alsoif the school hours aren't increasedstudents get some time for indulging in activities like sportsmusicpaintingdancing etc. which act as an escape from the stress which a student is undergoing.This helps in regaining the lost energy to study even with more enthusiasm.Thereforeschool hours shouldn't be increased.Q. If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?When was the last time you did something for the first time?Have you ever seen a person with loads and loads of knowledge about the world and wonder ""how is he so damn smart?""?Life is all about learning through experiences and the most enriching experiences are the ones which we get from travelling to a new place.Travelin the younger sortis a part of educationin the eldera part of experience.In my opinionwe travel not only to know about the customstraditionsnormsetc. of a new placewe also travel to find ourselves.We get to know a better insight of who we are when we travel alone.If I would like to go on a vacationthat will surely be a place which has a rich culture and also it should be tranquil enough to let the peace in the place settle down in my soul.That placeis Venice."

66,2,"PASSAGE 1:The education system of the world is on the cusp of development.It has experienced a great shift from the conventional classroom teaching to the teaching which is highly dependent on mass communication media like the internettvetc.Earlierprofessors used to indulge themselves only in doing research and taking lectures for the students in their own universities.Nowthey not only do the conventional classroom teachingbut they also are willing to spread their knowledge through TV by giving expert commentaryappearing as guests on television news program and many such similar tasks in which they come in the foreground and impart their knowledge to the commomn people.Professors coming and sharing the knowledge on a platform such as a television has many advantages.In addition to the professor himselfthe television appearances of these professors is lucrative for the host university as welll as the common public.The reputation of the professor increases as the knowledge of the professor is no more confined inside the university.People will start recognizing the professor as by the medium of television he has a reach to greater number of people of myriad backgrounds.Alsothe host university is benefitted as more number of meritorious students would turn towards the university for getting admission to get quality education by professors who are erudite in their respective fields.This concept also has several shortcomings.A lot of time of the professor is wasted in preparing for the material to be presentedtravelling to and fro the place of shooting and getting ready for the appearance.If he gives this amount of time in his reserach and in educating studentsit will be more beneficial for eeverybody.Moreoveras far as the general publice is concernedthe professor has to prepare his material to be delivered with respect to the general public.Thereforehe avoids using subject related jargonsdue to which the actual essence of the discussion or presentation is lost.Everything in the world has pros and cons.The gist of this essay lies in balancing between the two.It's upto the professor whatever he decides.Passage 2:YOUNG PEOPLE ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN OLDER PEOPLE DOI disagree with statement that young people enjoy life more than old people do.I support my opinion with the below mentioned examples.Older people are retired and don't have mundane jobs to dowhich young people have.Most of the elderly people are paid pensions by the Central Government which is the part and parcel of their life.Moreoverthey don't have that much expenses so that much money is sufficent for spending their lives.Because they don't go to workthey have the freedom to follow their passions and fulfill all their dreams.For exampleA retired army officer who has worked exceptionally hard for the past 40 years of his life has the freedom to pursue his hobbieslet's sayplaying guitar.He has lots of time to be proficient in that and it also gives him inner satisfaction as he has fulfilled the desire or yearning which was burning inside him since many years.Secondlyhaving gone through all the viccisitudes of lifeusually older generation desire for relaxedpeaceful and a slow-paced life.They usually enjoy being at homewith their family spreading their love and wisdom.Today's high-tech enjoyment involving speed and attention does give them their real enjoyment.By spending their time in parksplaying with their grand children and spending time with their family gives them most enjoyment.But the diversity of enjoyable things gives young people more chances to enjoy life compared to older one.To sum up there is a huge difference between young and older people to enjoy their life. Of course the older people can also enjoy their life according to their new age. However in some point they feel they are not able to do everything they want and in this manner they feel little boundary surrounding them. They might not feel fully enjoyed life like in their young age. On the other hand young people can able to enjoy life by being less responsible more energetic and more following up new things.Every individual has his or her respective way of enjoying life.In other wordsthe word ""enjoyment"" for each and every individual is subjective.What matters is our perspective.Irrespective of our agewe should enjoy life and take it as it comes because life is not a destinationit is a journey.Despite of the fact it has many highs and lowslife's like a roller coaster ride to be enjoyed to the fullest."

The music directors had given us a great music and the composers have written beautiful lines that are very meaningful.The movie makes us learn how we should make children learn. Not by force or not by scolding each and every time on their progress. But watching them at what they are good at. We should make them learn everything step by step guide them. This is what inspired me about the movie.MOVIE TITLE: TitanicWHY: The introduction of the movie shows the large ship that is Titanic. I have seen this movie when I am studying in my school days. There would be an excitement at that age watching those movies that people travelling in that ship. It’s a real life story and I felt that how did people prepare such a big ship and thousands of people died because of ice berg hitting the ship. The director James Cameron had done one of the highest grossing movie that it was not like watching a movie. It was like that is happening in front of us. I feel watching this movie many times and never get bored of this movie.This movie is an epic romance-disaster movie which inspired me about the characters in the movie. Not making the movie as boring the director created some characters in the movie which created a life for the movie.QUESTION 2:1.    Read the following essay prompts and write a suitable introductory paragraph for each of them using the 3 elements of introduction - hook orient readers and key terms:Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?I would like to go to Kerala on vacation because it has its own traditions and cultures. It is the most attracted tourist place with many beaches hill stations etc. We have many places to watch in Kerala like Munnar. We don’t know how heaven seems like. But god created this place and we can feel this place as heaven on the earth. The another places are Kerala backwaters and Guruvayur temple. We have many places to watch in Kerala. I feel like it’s a heaven on the earth. We have many places in Kerala where we feel relaxed and our mind will be peaceful pending time at those places. We have many dishes very special only in Kerala.We have Tea gardens and Kolukkumalai tea estate in Munnar where we find total greenery over there. Athirappilly waterfalls located in Thrissurit’s a Niagara of South India. It is a majestic beauty. Varakala beach in Varakala. It is such a beautiful beach in Kerla. My favarate place on this place to go to vacation is Kerala as I feel relaxed at this place. Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer.The school day should not be longer in my case. The whole day sitting in the school studying without any activities like sports affects the child health as well as they feel very stressed at that age. Only in the school days they can enjoy their life. After going out of the school for higher studies they don’t find time for sports and other activities concentrating on studies. If in the school itself they are habituated for longer hours sitting the whole day for study that would affect their brain. There should be limited school hours and after that 1-2 hours they should spend time on sports or other activities and get back to study after taking some rest. But continuous longer school day is not that good for them.As I had these longer school days without any sports or activities I feel that there should not be too stress on children regarding these long hour studies.

67,11,Altruism is the type of behaviour in which an animal sacrifices its own interest for that of another animal or group of animals. According to the lecture by sacrificing its own interest the animal harms itself because of other animals. The word Altruism is totally opposite of selfishness. By performing altruism both animals and humans they gain nothing by themselves. Some animals don’t share their food or anything with any other animals and as well as the humans too because they have the fear that they may harm by showing altruism. Unselfish acts among humans are ranging from sharing of food with strangers to the donation of body organs to family members. Some humans don’t share their food with anyone or don’t even donate their organs to their family members too because by doing such things they might feel that it may harm them. Many species of animals appear willing to sacrifice food or even their life to assist other members of their group. By sacrificing of life it may effect to the family of that animal species. They have given an example of a mammal called Meerkat. In groups of Meerkats an individual acts as a sentinel standing guard and looking out for predators while others hunt for food or eat food they have obtained. By acting as a sentinel it gains nothing infact it goes without food while others eat and places itself in danger. If the sentinel Meerkat sees a predator such as hawk approaching their group it gives an alarm cry alerting the other meerkats to run and seek shelter. According to me young adults should need an independence from their parents because being near parents they don’t even know how the world is. Once if they get independence from the parents they can know how the out life is. Being independent from parents they can learn more things than they are near their parents. Spoon feeding will be avoided if they are independent from their parents. By being independent from parents young adults can come to know how to mingle up with the world and people out. They will improve their guts and makes them grow up on their own without any help. But their independence from parents should not affect their future. They should use their independence in the right way. By having independence they can know the people outside much better and what’s going on with the world. If young adults prefer to live with their families they will be habituated to the environment of their family and can’t mingle with the outside world that easily. They don’t even come to know what is going on with the world but they will be safe with their parents. But I think we can learn more things by learning than by spoon feeding. So its better to live independent from parents and learn more things from the experiences being independent but that independence should not be used in a wrong way.
67,12,The points made in the lecture is that professors are normally found in the university classrooms offices and libraries. They do research and lecture the students. They also appear as guests in the television news program. They get the reputation rightly or may be in a wrong way if they appear in the television news program. These television channels invite the professors to increase their channel ratings. Some news channels entertain inviting these professors rather than to educate the viewers. There are many disadvantages to these professors to be a TV celebrity. These TV programs waste lot of time of these professors as they have to travel for rehearsal for makeup and for many takes. When a professor appears on TV thousands of people outside the narrow academic community become aware of the professor’s idea. By being on TV as a celebrity professors waste a lot of time. Most of the times they will be in TV studio rather than in the campus with the students taking lectures. Universities might benefit for such appearances of their professors on TV. They receive positive publicity such as when people see knowledgeable faculty they think more highly about university and that improves their reputation. Viewers have a chance to learn something new and they can experience real expertise. But this waste a lot of time of professors.

67,6,On November 9thI went to a restaurant with my friends to celebrate my birthday. We ate well enjoyed a lot. That was an awesome food we had as it is more expensive restaurant and famous throughout India at different places. It was around 12a.m. we came out. Almost it was late night. I found a woman who might be 93 years old sleeping outside on the footpath beside the restaurant with torn clothes and no food begging us for money. I felt upset seeing her in that situation. I went again into the restaurant which is about to close after our departure. I asked them for the food but they replied that food has been finished. I requested them to give any of the food left for the day. They gave me some food which they had in their kitchen. I gave that food to the old woman and a scarf which I have with me to cover her body. At that point I thought that I need to make a decision about the old woman’s shelter. I took her with me and dropped her in an old-age home where she gets proper shelter and food. She felt very happy and dropped down into tears towards me.Try to help old people who are in need .

68,1,Professors should only confined to universities and they should work on their research because if a professors comes out the university and suppose to deliver his subject in the television he may not give the entire subject to the students or the audience because there will a wide range of factors for him before coming to the television as it will take a long time for him to collaborate with the television systems. If he is about to do his work by publishing the journals and making them happen in the real world it will give him the most success than anything there were research scholars who bagged noble awards for their research and enhancement of the technologies all these people were never been to televoision or never spoke in front of television as their vision is to get something out of nothing rather than loosing everything without anything. Media people will not give a sufficient time to open up their individual topics and to elaborate in front of the television. So it is good for the professors to do the research work with the help of university people and if the research was successful and it has its wide advantage in the future developments then the organizations will come up and make the scholars name reverberate all through the televisions. So the best and foremost options for the research scholars is to go with the journals and they can find prominent information from the different type of search engines if their project was successful they even can upload their information In the search engines so that students can be benefitted. Coming before the television can junk a lot of time and they even miss the regular classes which they need to take in the university. So the importance and value of a scholar is known mostly by their journals and their contributions to their fields.It is obvious that young once will enjoy their respective life more often than the older once because there is certain age limit for everyone to which one will have a time to enjoy beyond their limits with in that range people might enjoy beyond their regular enjoyment. It is between the age of 10-24years people will enjoy most of it and this is the time to enjoy as the people will be more energetic and have a hassle free life as their were under supervision of their parents and the parents will provide them whatever they want. This is the most crucial time to guess the rest of the life if anyone who is beyond the ethics in their enjoyment they need suffer the rest of the life. The best time in anyone’s life is the schooling period their we enjoy a lot unknowingly we don’t have any restrictions at that time and we can enjoy what ever we wished for. After schooling we were bit tied in the knot of parents as we go by as this Is the most crucial time in our lives. In graduation there was enough time to enjoy the life as it is four or five years in parallel with the academics we can do things what ever we want and by that time we had enough knowledge of what is good and what is bad. So after the graduation our real life starts where we were supposed to embedded with a lot of responsibilities and emotions. we will have a life partner we need to take of the people around us and for the people for us so in this time it depends on the individual on the way he enjoys his life. However enjoyment is of individual perspective and the way he wants his life to be. Everyone will not be same in terms of enjoyment and it is not necessary that everyone will be having the same mind set or think of the same things. Many will feel of having a joint family and it makes them feel happy and they want to enjoy with their family the real happiness depends on the individual how he wants to be and how he designed his life to get into the enjoyment. There were many cases where people enjoyed more often when they were ageing or getting older. It might be due to lack of economical support at that time or any other factors. But at the older age people like to enjoy as much as they can but due to their health condition and other factors they may not go to that extent but it even depends on their determination and how enthusiastic they were. But in my opinion young people will be having a time with energy to enjoy more

You are disappointed with his team skills and need to give a feedback on that.2. His rating on presentation skills by client has not been that impressive and so feedback needs to be given.3. His biggest drawback is lack of assertiveness and needs to be given feedback on that aspect as well. Try to be professional at the same time try to give the right feedback so that he can improve on those skills.To: Subject: Regarding performance appraisal.Hello WoakesIts pleasure that we had completed our first demonstration on project deployment and today I’m here to discuss salient performance based issues. I’ve observed Team skills was a major cause and concern as you people were not effectively communicating with the other fellow mates it would drastically changes the intervention of your project display. Its better that you need to interact with your team mates effectively and always stand on a same note.While I was interacting with the clients they were really unhappy with your presentation skills and they also mentioned that it is an half- hearted approach and not well organized. So please keep it in mind you will not repeat it further. I suggest you to always maintain an reference sheet before the day of presentation.There was a biggest drawback in your presentation is lack of assertiveness you are easily compelling and get manipulated by the clients take it on a serious note it should not repeat any further because when we are portraying our project it is always necessary to stick on to the topic rather than to get manipulated Hope you will show the improvement in the next attempt.Thanks & RegradsVinay Krishna.PTeam LeadPokemon Software SolutionsHyderabadIndia
68,7,1.This is all we called it as an nothing impersonel and sacrifice for the people around . The quality of the life defines the nature of the living beings. We dont find altruism in all the living creatures but there were some of the living beings which are conditionally or unconditionally will show their respect for their live and not only to their lives but also to the others life. This altruism cannot be seen in many of the living beings sometimes these people will give up their lifes for faulty causes but it is upto them and the surrounding environment should also have an influence on him there were people will help to each other without texpecting any thing from the others this mentality should be cultivated in each and every human so that the more we help the more the people gets benefitted by us. So we sholud expect as much less as we can but we can help as much as we can. hepling doesnt mean to give our own life for others it is to comforting others who were in difficult times. every people are busy with their schedules and works but there will be enough time for everyone t o just think of the society and as an individual what are their contributions for the society. if one thinks in this way and from one to other the culture starts cultivating and finally gets into a colourful living environmentmeerkat was one of the best example for the living beings to know how one and other sacrifices for other . however we dont need to sacrifice our life atleast we need to donate the things which are not under our control and which are going waste2.independence for an individual is an individual perspective.there were certain instances where people are much often tries to escapes from their houses and want to live in without their family members the reason might be from the parent side or the environment which he is living on. There wer many situations and factors the human being meant to forcome. It is due to the parents some adults might become frustated in their lives and want to come out of their house but these type of people cannont adjust in their lives as parents were the most conforting aspects in our lives if we feltany problem because of them then it might be a difficult task for him to survive all around. parents were the barriers for their children as they need to get in on how to nurture them and how to have a situations where adults wants to know they need to insist with their feedbacks and past stories and difficulties so that the adults need to understand their problems as much ease as they res arebcan.people of difficult background and difficult cultures and backgrounds are unable to cope up with the public around them. there were instances were adults were trafficking into drugs and other toxications . if proper guidelines and proper behavious been insisted by the parents then it will be an easy task for them even if they go oput as an individual they can cope up with the things around

69,1,QUESTION 1:A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie. List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them.Format:MOVIE TITLE:Batman darkknight joker entrance WHY:Dark Knight : In previous movies Batman as strong protagonist.Starting scene shows a bank robbery execution which is highlight in itself .It shows psychology of joker and ideological differences between Batman and joker .So it sets the inevitable conflict for them.QUESTION 2:1. Read the following essay prompts and write a suitable introductory paragraph for each of them using the 3 elements of introduction - hook orient readers and key terms:Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?I would go to Machu Picchu.It's an ancient capital of incan civilization .It's view from top is remarkable.It will pass as a great choice for an adventurous vacation .Plus you get to do mountain treking which is by the way just an 1or 1.5 hours journey.So it would benefit your health too.Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer.I believe that school day should not be longer.My reasons are that students need to implement what they have learnt at school.There won't be enough time to practise what student has read if time is spent too much in school.And i strongly believe that learning happens after school.Yes students need to prepare for higher education but sports are equally important.A healthy body develops a healthy mind.On longer school days even teachers get tired of longer sessions and may not be able to focus on students better.Its in every bodies interest to take a break.So I suggest working school hours be reduced.Thank you.

69,7,TASK 1Altruism is opposite of selfishness Altruistic behaviour of an animal benefits members of group at the peril of animal.But many species of animals willingly sacrifice food life to assist other members meerkat in grasslands of Africa is an example.Unselfish acts among us range from sharing of food to donation of organs.In group of meerkats a sentinel stands out looking for predators while other meerkats feed and it has to flee alone placing itself in great peril.Recent research suggests that sentinels eat before standing gaurd and they are near the burrow than rest of them .So observing closely we can state that sentinels indeed benefit from acting on behalf of group interest.Also humans do get appreciation from other people by donating their organs and an increased self worth.So altruistic deeds do get rewarded in psychologically if not materially TASK2I personally prefer being independent .Because I don't want to be dependent on them I want to do my own thing and my own way.As I mature into adult i want to see the world with my eyes And to form my own opinions. This can't happen if parents meddle into children lifestyleThey have to treat them as adults and have to give their own space. Other people might feel the need to have support and so seek guidance.Some people think it's better to navigate life being with their family.Having cultural difference and upbringing can result in different type of choice a teenager makes.For example young people in India choose to remain with their parents and sometimes refuse to join in hostels while in foreign i.e USA parents would send out their children as soon as they reach certain age.

69,9,Q1.review on paragraghScholalrly community doesn’t take seriously who appear in tv .They are going to think that it benefits professors only .Also professors who appear on tv don’t discuss subject in intellectual depth as they do in university .Even anchors can supplement what content the professors with little of their research.In lecture professor argues that serious professors do their reserch in university and by publishing in journal .Thats how any professor gets reputation in acedemic community.Do young people enjoy more than Old people.Well it depends on perspective how one chooses to say what is enjoyment. Old people in general are not in good shape of their health. So they can’t travel to a place even when they want. But it’s going to be a problem if you think travel is only option to entertainment .They can spend with their grandchildren or meet relatives to share memories. Old people are not lagging behind in using technology .Some people like solitary moments like reading books or filing sudoku in their private time i.e my grandmother still likes crossword puzzles. They can surf net and watch Netflix online. They are not lagging in using technology. Infact being old freed their time up to pursue their hobbies or interests.I read in a book that by reaching old age people tend to less think what others might think of them so they have less pressure to attain anything they choose to attain. They tend to accumulate experiences from their life which they form a perspective. Lets discuss the issue this era is competitive and even young people have to burn their midnight oil to stay competitive . Also we can’t say we really enjoy if we can’t take a short break from life. We didn’t have enough time to spend with family and friends. So I can’t just say young people enjoy a lot even .And people enjoyment depends on ones perspective . For most adults they want to spend time with family to share their experiences .It’s their form of enjoyment.
7,1,Freedom means to have the right to do and say whatever you like.Now a days people are suffering for freedom in some places like village.i think of all the wars out country has foughtand still its fightningso we can have the wonderful gift of freedomthere have been many brave women and men who have risked their lifes to get freedom but we still have women and men who are fighting for freedom.Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible.because in developed countries like US and Australia people being given by freedom and stand on their feet.it will improve their knowledge and responsibility skills.they will become more independent if they stand on their own.they can make their own decisions and earn money. If young adults are being given by freedom and let their parents leave.And some young adults prefer to live with their own parents and family members for long time.at one point of view its better to stay with family.if any problem occurs for a single person everyone will help them.unity plays major role here.that is what our country wants.by staying by our family will give more encouragement and more comfortableness.if we grow up in our parents hand will become decipline and we stay happily and healthy.Some of my relatives fought in different ways like my cousins fought with their own parents to let them go out study for two years.but their parents did not allow them to go.instead of that they asked to stop studying and stay at home.in some villages young adults are suffering with freedom.I support staying out of home and learning things and feed food on our own make our country better.everybody should stand on their own without depending on someone. everybody should stand on their own without depending on someone.freedom is gift that should earn by ourselfOften the science has found four section examNow studies and their behaviour is became much more costly then otherThe interesting thing was found like eating habitsOnce upon a time the guard had heavy stomach acheAfter he run immediately to burn after the alarmOne man looking for food he is actually in dangerAlarm might cause to other team and they will move out quicklyIt will increase animals from survivalsWhat about people? A person might be a relative or stranger Downer will consider it very valuable for some peopleBut some people won’t get rewards from some strangers.

7,11,Character: A college student.Setting: A college library.Time: late at night.Situation : A death has occurred. When I was in college used to go library in the nights because I was very studious that time .As we were given a huge assignment’s every day we couldn’t get time to go to library in the college hours.Our library was same like a palace. Everybody wants go and study over there. We can find Many subject books novels newspapers were available there .Actually to be frank i used to go there to visit that peaceful place every day because when it is very calm I concentrate on what I study . There was a rowdy gang in my college who fights with faculty and other branch students. They got a bad name from entire college.one day that gang was ragging a junior who just joined in the college 1 week back. The name who undergone with torture was Rana he is very intelligent and smart looking.Rana was tortured by the rowdy gang and from that moment he suddenly disappeared from the college. Principle and friends tried calling him but couldn’t find him. The college library has closed because of this issue. And I came to know that one junior was missing and he is the fresher. As everyone knew that rowdy gang have done some murders before in the college students started blaming them for this too. However I took it light and as usual I went to college library to see whether the it is opened yet or not.Luckly library was reopened and I started reading books like I do daily. Suddenly some student was screaming like anything. Everybody in the library went and saw the situation. Guess what? They found one dead body in the corner of library. As I said you the library was like a palace it is not possible to see each corner of Library. And the most shocking new to the entire college was that the dead body that they found was the person who tortured by the rowdy gang. Yes he was Rana.He died because that rowdy gang has done a embarrassing task to rag him so he decided to do suicide

7,4,MODULE : When i was searching some career websites this week i noticed that your company has a lookout for an intern this summer. The position sounds great. Can you call me back and email and inform me about the application process.
7,5,WRITING BASED ON READING AND LISTENING:The professors are normally found in universitys classroomsofficersand libraries doing research and lecturing to their students.and they appear as guests on television news progrmsgiving expert commentary on latest event in the world.But in lecture they oppose that the famous professors in universities may not be invited to TV’s.Its not good for professors to waste their important time on Tv that will prove their standards.The lecturer who is a great professor or senior professor may not be invited to Tv’s.These tv appearances are not benefited to the professors themselves as well as to their universities and the general public. When the professors share their ideas with a television audience the professors importance as scholors not enhanced.Universities will loose the positive opinion on professors because being a good professor he may not spend his valuable time on television.When people see a knowledge faculty member of a university on television they think that he is not utilizing his time on students rather then he his wasting his time on tv.Finallythe public gains the knowledge but the professors loose his valuable time on tv’s.there is no need to showing faculty themselves on televisions .Young people enjoy their life more than older people doEveryone has his/her own opinion about certain things. Everybody has their own tastes. May be some people think that it’s not true that older people enjoy their life less than the young people do. But it is correct that the young people feel great life happiness than older people.First of all young people have so many advantages like we learn faster and our intellect is broader and richer than the old person. Because it’s just a beginning of our life we have to learn and have more fun in this beautiful stage of life. But as for old people they had experience in their lives they are not expecting anything because they already felt them. There nothing more interesting things in their future life.Secondly we should agree with the reality that younger people look beautiful and better. Well we cannot do anything in this matter. It’s the law of nature that humans get older and older. Childhood always described as a time of sincere happiness time when there are no serious problems and worries.it is the best to leave in their imaginative world.Thirdly on earth there are people who reach happiness in an advanced age. Like for example if I take a real life incident I have met a couple who get married at 60 years old. It's not that common but it exists.  I think the best example and the saddest one is the people who suffer of a disease. Young middle-aged old they all enjoy life as much as they can and that is the beauty of life. You don't have to wait to be happy or enjoy at a precise moment. You just do.Thus everyone can enjoy life regardless the age it's just a question of attitude and personality. Though there are passages in your life (students retired persons) which can lead you to different kind of joy. The joy stays the same it's just your conception who changed.
7,6,QUESTION 1:A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie. List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them.Format:MOVIE TITLE: BahubaliWHY: The movie starts off with Shivagami a queen exiting a cave. She is seen holding a baby close to her chest. Two soldiers exit the cave after her and seem to be following the queen. The queen then cleverly kills the two soldiers but looses the strength to run any farther. She then prays to the gods for the baby to survive keeping her life on the line.I find the opening of this movie memorable as the actor who portrayed the role as the queen did a very good job. The role itself was shown to be courageous and loving throught the scene. It shows a mother’s caring and love to save her baby from evil. MOVIE TITLE : Wolverine WHY: The movie starts in Nagasaki at the time when a nuclear bomb was dropped on it. Logan along with his ally start running as the enemy starts raining bombs on them. Logan finds a sewer that he thinks would be perfect for them to escape the bombardment. They enter the sewer but when the nuclear bomb is dropped Logan places himself in front of his ally and protects him from the fire. Logan’s body is burnt but it slowly starts regenerating thus revealing that Logan is a mutant.The opening shows good graphics and makes the audience believe that it was filmed during war. The graphics are very good and the helping nature and abilities of the main character is perfectly shown.QUESTION 2:1.    Read the following essay prompts and write a suitable introductory paragraph for each of them using the 3 elements of introduction - hook orient readers and key terms:Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longerESSAY 1My family is saving and planning for two incredible adventures Very beautiful question indeed. I shall first like to travel the whole of my country. I mean almost the whole. As nobody can do it one single lifetime. If you mean foreign country- then russia anytime. I just love that cold dark country.they are so womanly and know how to seduce a man. Another factor being the cultural similarity with us Indians. Russians tend to connect on the same emotional level like Indians If not above them which I guess nobody can. Lol.I think we Indians could do that Again like we did in ancient times. And ofcourse there is Tatar finno- Ugric Siberia far east beauties too.. But I love this place. So Russia central Asia Canada Australia eastern Europe Venice Paris and Switzerland Columbia Latin America( brazil) for me.ESSAY 2 The school day should be not longer and more universal in start times. Summer vacation is a throwback to when the United States was an agricultural economy. Kids need to be in school longer and need to be learning the skills that relate to today's job market. But as point of view the time limit of schools should decrease and education is part of learning but not a life. The government needs to step up and increase education funding. In turn teachers should be banned from unionizing but have their pay increased so they are paid like the professionals they are supposed to be. I would pay teachers a minimum of $70000 a year but no job security and no tenure. They would be made to reapply for their jobs every year and the decision to hire them back would be based on how well the students are learning. Each school should only have one principal and one vice principle. Here in Los Angeles we have schools with 10 vice principals. Christie has a good idea but it should be part of a larger reform package. Right now our schools are failing our kids. It does not have to be this way. China sends their kids to school at least 10 hours a day and there is no such thing as summer vacation. The rest of the world is laughing at us. The United States is like that middle aged guy who works some dead end job but all he talks about is the 4 touchdowns he scored in the high school championship game. America is no longer exceptional when it comes to educating its children.

70,1,If I could go anywhere I would go to.............If I could go anywhere in the world for vacation I would go to the Bahamas .These tropical islands are near the coast of Florida. The climate in tropical regions is very amazing. This would be a correct place for relaxing far from our responsibilities and worries of our daily stress. Bahamas is famous for its climate.Apparoximately the climate in this region is about 75 degree Fahrenheit in winter. Since the climate is very good there is no scope for tan and all the insects that cause harm to us. Without these creatures a holiday trip will be enjoyable.It is famous for its Islands and beaches. This place is very pleasant for beaches and greenery all around. The fresh water air and surroundings are very beautiful. In my research I found that more than three fourth of Bahamas lie under water. Coming an interesting topic about food is Bahamas. As I said earlier it is place of beaches and oceans so it is famous for sea food. This is a good place for water games like scuba diving sports fishing sailing and swimming with dolphins. The common wealth of the Bahamas would be the perfect place for a vacation .Don’t you agree? It is tourist friendly and I have told you all about the place in above paragraphs. If I could for vacation here I would be the most happiest Vacationer.As a teacher I would strongly support short school days only. In our modern world of education the average student ranging from all grades and ages go through a school to time of seven to seven. Working for that many hours will definitely lead student to stress. It is clear that most of school children are interested to skip their school because of stress and long hours of school days. From my survey I found that so many children have committed suicide because of stress in schools and long working hours only.Coming to the stress of the day a wide range of students including younger ages are consumed with a variety of clubs jobs and sports. After the long working hours students will come across a big problem that is homework. They need to complete it anyhow with half asleep but what about their studying?Children need at least 8 hours of sleep a day. But because of their hectic schedule they are not even having sufficient sleep. My niece who is about 12 years old will spend only 4-5 hours on her homework per day after her school .This is very ridiculous.

70,12,"Advantages and Disadvantages of Professors on TV showThere are two different views explained in passage and on video .This was completely about advantages and disadvantages of professors on television in daily life. The professors who appear on television are unable to spend more time in university as they need to spend lot of time in front of cameras instead of classrooms. But professors who appear on TV get more popularity in people and also get lots of reanimations for the valuable statements made by them on shows.By this the professors who are not more published or popular is going to come out and show his or her skills to the common world. These kinds of professors are not invited to great conferences. Knowledge is power. People with high qualifications think that TV shows is much concentrating on the materials used by person or university where they work rather than stuff.TV shows give more importance to ""Title rather than Material "".In my view it is not required to show talent of person in front of everybody. We need to prove ourselves when we are in a challenge.”I believe knowledge is power. I don’t have people to relay on so I have to be self-sufficient”.Yes I do agree with the statement that young age people make much fun in their lives .It actually do not depend on age whether we enjoy in our life or not but during young age people do not really have to answer for anything that they do. People in this age have no other responsibilities other than achieving goals to have a bright future. People must also have enjoyment in acquiring goals in their life. Young people attract more towards friends and having fun .In young age our surroundings and health conditions also helps us more to enjoy more during young age.But people can even have lots of enjoyment in old age. For example if we take Mickle Jackson who is famous all around the world .He not only enjoyed during his young age but also made miracles in old age.But to have a bright and colourful future we need to enjoy our young age my achieving goals and by facing lots of challenges .In young age we enjoy every moment of life because everything is new and fun to make. Actually we make lots of memories in young age with our friends and college days remains us much joy in our lives. We make comments on people we bunk classes we will go for trips with friends we spend lots of time to read novels we enjoy a lot during young age. You should have a criteria to enjoy by achieving goals to have a bright future that will never lead us to problems during old age.Finally I conclude saying that young is probably good time to enjoy. One should enjoy lot during young age that remains as memories in old age."
70,2,P.SUCHARITHA IH201685070Sources for College Writing Students can draw on a variety of sources to help them with writing assignments. First they can draw on personal experiences. For example for an assignment about communication skills a writer might think about the way he or she communicates through conversations with others while at work or at home. In addition a writer might look at ways he or she communicates with others electronically via email or texting or Facebook. Students might also find examples of written communication skills by looking at skills they’ve learned for previous writing assignments. Second student writers can look for ideas from other people’s experiences. For instance writers can interview other students or even family members. Additionally a writer may have heard others talk about this topic maybe in class. For one thing Source would be television shows on the topic of communication. All in all college writers may find that they need to do some research to complete an assignment.On the whole lots of experts have written articles or books on the topic of communication skills. As one can see a search of “communication skills” on the internet might provide useful information; Moreover reference librarians can help students find research materials in special collections or databases. Finally college writers need to be able to draw on a combination of personal experience observations of others and research materials to develop their written assignments

70,7,"Task 1:Selfishness is quite opposite to altruism where one of them deals with extreme great job and the other deals with an issue where animals sacrifice themselves to be part of food for some others.It is found that meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrow s of Africa is a great example .In this kind they kill themselves to be part of others food and on other side we found predators which are in hunt .In humans also we have some people who donate body parts for others where those kind of people are praised a lot and get lots of regards from others. As they give life for a new person.Whereas animals are not given such kind of importance but they assist themselves to be part of our food. So altruistic sentinel behavior helps ensure the survival of other members of meerkats groupEASSY:Being a young adult i do support with the second option that is young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. In my point of view parents are visible god to us .They are the one who sacrifice their whole life to make us happy. Family is one which dont tend to expect anything from us intend .It is a place where we don't need to act good in front of others and a place where we have our own freedom. Actually i give much importance to family in my life. It would be very courageous to be part of great family . Parents are one who gives and everything and expects nothing from children except love .And is our duty to be part of their life during old age and help them to keep helping when they are in need of us. We must treat them as our kids when we grow up and what they need is our love and caring.I think it better to live with a family where we have lots of fun and much effections.For suppose if u are having a couple of kids at home what all they do is just have a laptop or a mobile and starts surfing to internet or playing games. Other than that they can't know any moral values .Suppose if your kids are in a joint family they have their cousins to plat they have their grandparents to know stories .If both are working in a small family we need to drop our kids in play schools but i think that is not going to be a right way to grow my children being part of my life. Parents do lot for us and it is our duty o help them when they are in need and it is not just like need it is our duty to take care of them. Everybody love their parents but leaving them helpless and moving to other place to have fun does not make any sense to me.What is the need to stay away from familiy?If it is just for money that money does not give any life or hapiness to u but if u be happy with your family and make it fruit basket.Here by i conclude that with a statement that ""Be happy with your parents and give a happy life to your children by staying in a family that would make your life great and high""."

71,1,Here the author is comparing the behavior among mammals and even in humans.He says that altruism is a type of behavior where an animal sacrifies its own interest to another animal or other group of animals.In this he tells about groups of Meerat that if a group of meerat goes for a hunt then one among that is going to look for any predator while the others hunt. By standing guard it gains nothing it goes without food and even stands in danger but the animals in group can do more than they are in single. It protects other lives from danger This is like an example to say how the altruistic sentinel behavior towards others.Author also say that some humans will donate their organs to their family members or for any strangers too.Author wants to focus on altruism behavior in humans and even in mammals that means he wants to say they are some kind who always care for other and they are of opposite to selfish nature and want to offer help and even they sacrifice their own interest. So the altruistic behavior helps ensure the survival of other members.#writing-2Getting a thought to be independent is good because one should be more independent.He/she shouldn’t depend on others here depending is—They should get their things ready and should have knowledge on what they are doing.According to me being independent from their family is like appreciating because they will be knowing how to behave with others and how to mingle and how to tackle others how to face problems and even how to get the solution for that.This is want actuall independent is.Being independent makes one to learn many things like I already mentioned they will know how to behave speak and even face others which are the most important things to be learned in one’s life.One shouldn’t take advantage of being independent and they shouldn’t forget their moral values what their family had made them to learn these many days.By being independent they even more make their life beautiful they can plan more effectively.At first or in the beginning they mayn’t handle properly but after that they can schedule properly and will know how to plan their life.Most of the adults will do this with the help of their parents or families but for me its not correc tbecause it’s our life we need to lead it so decision must be taken by us. We need to plan those we can ask for suggestions but couldn’t depend on others for decision.So being independent makes us to learn many things and even helps to lay a good path.we ourselves should lead our life no one helps us so if we’re independent from beginning we can make our life easy and can get solution even in the worst situations.This is want we really want in life and this makes us to be brave enough to handle the worst situations too and this means we’re succeed in journey of lifethis is what a true success is and every man need this. TASK: 1Meerkats are really not so self less as mentioned in passage because they are the one who eat first among all and act as guard.But it was mentioned in the passage that they sacrifice their life for others and act as guard. whenever the predator comes their job is to alert the other Meerkats But in the content it was mentioned that being guard they have a great advantage to escape from the predator because they stand on barriers while others search for food so they can escape into burrows before anyone can.In the content it was mentioned that even humans does not donate donate blood or organs selflessly. They gain some or the other sort of appreciation in the form of money or appraisal. But in passage it was quite opposite where some people Meerkats and Mammals are expected to do the things without any returns. There are very few persons who donate their organs without expectations. But some don’t. Humans expect things in return of favour may be in the situation where their own relatives are in danger. So there is no point in things that Meerkats and humans act selflessly.The situation differs where people do the things in selfishness and being self-centered. The moto may be positive but the intension is negative.Task: 2The issue is about does young adults prefer to be with their parents or like to be independent. In my point of view there are advantages as well disadvantages in both the points. The young adults like independence rather than being with their parents because there is one to question that person for whatever he does. There is no form of interference in their personal life. These young adults feel free to do the things. They lead the life in their own way. The have very less sentimental values. But in some situation in life this sort of attitude makes the life very complicated. There are many cases where the chance of miss leading is higher compared to be right. There will be no proper person to guide about what is really good and bad. Or no elder one who can suggest opinions for any decision that young people take. Elders are considered to be very experienced. They can be guides for young people. But in some cases the issue is quite opposite. Where the young want to be with their parents. In this case the young become dependent. They may can’t do the things independently or take decisions independently. And in some situations young people still may want to live with their parents but they cannot because of many situations like their studies job or may because of marital problems etc. In my point of view I support to the second situation. There may be any reason for young to be stay away with their parents these reasons are for temporary. Only for some period of time these young stay but they finally stay with their parents. Bonding in between the people increases. There is supportive guide at the back. Young can be more religious and can have family oriented mindsets. Only blessed can live with their parents in their life.

He is in the flight going outstation then suddenly he gets a call. Then he gets a heart attack the flight was landed back because of the emergency When he was taken to the hospital he gets up and jumps up and says he very fine and runs away. He does so because the call he received was from one of his college mate saying that he has found his best friend. Faran wants to meet his best friend as he disappeared after the college.

MOVIE TITLE: Chak De IndiaWHY: The opening scene was the final match of “World Men’s Hockey Championship” between “Arch Rivals” India and Pakistan. In which India loses to Pakistan with 0-1 margin. After the end of the match Kabir Khan(Shah Rukh Khan) shakes the hands with the Pakistan’s captain with great sports man spirit but one of the media channel misunderstands it and publishes negatively as he was responsible for India loosing the match. He was blamed for no reason. After that hockey India Federation bans him playing for the country and files a court case against him.

The places I want to visit in my vacation is seven wonders of the world. The seven wonders of the world areGreat wall of China ChinaPetra JordanThe colosseum ItalyChichen Itza MexicoMachu Picchu PeruTaj Mahal IndiaChrist the Redeemer BrazilThese are the seven wonders becauseMACHU PICCHU: Most Archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was built as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the “Lost City of the Incas” it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish ConquestTAJ MAHAL: It was built in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favorite wife Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 42-acre complex which includes a mosque and a guest house and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.CHICHEN ITZA Also known as the Temple of Kukulcan is a Mesoamerican step-pyramid that dominates the center of the Chichen Itza archaeological site in the Mexican state of Yucatán. The building is more formally designated by archaeologists as Chichen Itza Structure 5B18.CHRIST THE REDEEMER The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long 700 short tons) and is located at the peak of the 700-metre (2300 ft) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca Forest National Park overlooking the city of Rio. A symbol of Christianity across the world the statue has also become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil and is listed as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone and was constructed between 1922 and 1931.GREAT WALL OF CHINA The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone brick tamped earth wood and other materials generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe.

The city is famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system. Another name for Petra is the Rose City due to the colour of the stone out of which it is carved.THE COLOSSEUM Also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome Italy. Built of concrete and sand it is the largest amphitheatre ever built.Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer. Every school board should give the equal importance to the study and sports because along with the studies the sports also plays a very crucial role in one’s student life. According to me everyone will not be successful due to studies itself along with the studies sports also need some time in every student life sports should become the part of the students life because sports helps the students to take the decisions quickly wisely and that too correctly. They helps the students to relax from regular burden/studies and they can be physically fit. Leadership qualities decision making skills team work skills can be improved due to the sports. Moreover many sports persons in the world are school or college dropouts (Sachin Tiger woods Messi etc) but they are well reputed and respected in the society So consideration all the above facts school board should not implement longer school days but instead make sport practices as a part of daily curriculum.

In new day schools students explore music and the arts a remarkable variety of enrichment activities as well as a range of programs in social and emotional learning. All these activities contribute mightily to helping children receive a truly well-rounded education. There will be improvement in the overall school learning climate by raising attendance. These will be great enhancement in students life. so this will give great impact if only school day will be longer."

72,14,Task-1lecturer was opposing the showcasing of professor where she said that professor on television is not good for professor. Lecturer mention disadvantages of professor being on television. Firstly professor comes on television are just for gaining more popularity or enhancing more reputation those professors are not serious scholar they are only for entertain. A real professor will give much importance to academic work and will have more discussion on academic. Secondly By doing this all process it will take lot of professor's time which will be for rehearsing before broadcasting looking good in front of cameras travelling time and so on. A professor can avoid all these things by meeting to students attending board meetings doing a research work and so on. A professor have lots of knowledge to offer where he can showcase more for academic work rather than intellectual substance where he will be saying about background on current events and so on. Task-2I agree with the given statement i.e young people enjoy life more than old people. As young people will be free birds as they have freedom and enjoys their life to the fullest but old people will also be enjoying their life in their own world by being happy and so on.for example young people can go for adventurous trips work outs participate in active works and so on. They will be enjoying their life as well as be serious in life at some point of time. Old people will be enjoying by leading a happy life but their may be some complications regarding health issues which make them little inactive but that doesn't mean they don't enjoy life.I would like to conclude by saying both life of young people as well as old people will some same in their own world.

I am as lucky as I have a good friend from my childhood. Her name is Pooja We are good friends from the childhood and still continue. She is a smart girl having fair complexion and tall . She is a pretty girl I still remember that we were met in our kindergarten class and became great friends forever. She is very entertaining jolly and helpful in nature. She understands me a lot and become always ready to help me in my all bad or happy conditions. We go to the college everyday together and play sports daily in the nearby ground of our house.Write a blog entry in 300 words on the topic ‘A Typical Day At My College’. You can describe the academic and social activities at your college and any unique aspects of your learning environment.A typical day at IIIT Hyderabad; I stays in campus hostel and  It is my habit to get up early in the morning. I will do breeze walk within campus and after that I play shuttle badminton in court which is within campus. After that I get ready for class. Now coming to academic activities. In class we'll have many activities like discussing on subject with mentor one-to-one sessions self study daily exams and so on. The interesting part is Programming contest which can improve our programming skills.Moreover we have Soft Skill sessions which is a plus point for getting through interview process. In soft Skill sessions we can improve our communication skill presentation skill and so on. There are many activities we do in Soft Skill sessions which are stepping stone for cracking interviews. We will have two sessions i.e first is offline session where we interact with mentor and will have one- to-one discussion as well as group discussion and second is online sessions where we learn new topics daily and do some tasks.Now coming to social activities In our college there will be many social activities which will be held more often. The activities like blood donation workshops TED talks visiting to orphanage and so on. There are many sports event held in our college. Many students participate in these extracurricular activities which improve mental and physical fitness.

72,9,TASK -1The topic is based on Altruism which is opposite of selfishness which is also type of behaviour where animal sacrifices its own interest for that of another animal or group of animals. There are some animals like meerkat mammals who start their food before standing in front of god their behaviour is completely different from other kind of meerkat . The other kind of meerkat will be searching for food endearing danger that will be moving from place to place.There are many species of animals who are willing to sacrifice their belongings and even their lives to assist others members of group. For example the sentinel meerkat is most likely to escape as it sees the hunters because it is the first one to see the hunters and the rest of meerkat group will be gather and departs here and there to escape from danger and save their lives.The group of meerkat mammals will alarm each other by making crying sound to escape from predator where they are group together to save each other life from predator. There is another example of altruism that is about humans. People who sacrifice their own food or organ of their body will not be appreciated or rewarded for their good deed. A person is precious and valuable and someone who is sacrificing their life for others should be rewarded.TASK-2The topic is about independence or dependence of living with their families for some young adults. There are some adults who have different perspective towards life which they had probably reflect in their career life. The most important thing is to take decision where the individual thinks about life.In my point of view young adult should be prefer to live with families for longer time as there is so much to learn from them which may not result the same by living or staying away from them. For example people who stay away or want independence from their parents probably will be facing more difficulties like staying health issues bad accompany influenced bad habits and so on where no one will be there to teach them. So finally I would like to conclude by saying staying with families will be better than being away from them.
73,1,Professors attending to the tv show is a sensitive issue that changes from the professor to professor according to the video the important points which are raised in order to oppose the program of professor for a tv show areIts mostly believed that the professors who are no up to the mark may get some reputation that the existing ones even though he’s is not eligible to that due to his wrong delivery of information there may be miss communication between the listeners and the subject the tv professors are not allowed for seminars and he may not be supported with funds for his research the TV professors waste time by travelling here and there even for their makeup etcinstead of wasting that time they can spend it in the university and help the students tv networks doesn’t need must depth subject so the tv professors may leave the topic abruptly and jump into some other business so its better for the serious professors no to attend the TV lectures and instead of that helping students will be good enough.
73,2,I completely agree with the statement that the “young people enjoy life more than the old do” for several reasons. Coming to the first point the young have many ways to enjoy their life than the older ones. Technology provides the younger ones to enjoy more and relax in different ways. Internet is very popular and common among the young people for those who want to enjoy we face many social websites to chat and for being refreshed but it is not common among the older. With the available of the new technology the young have more different choices to enjoy their lives than the older do. But in the prospective of the older ones the young have less limitation to enjoy their life than the older do. For example the young have stronger body and more energy than the older do. They can go rock-climbing which requires a lot of concentration and body strength. They can go for bike races and they can participate in any sport in which they are interested but that doesn’t work with older ones because they may have some limitations with respective to age they may have health issues also. Thinking with flexibility leads people more fit in their life. Older people sometimes consider based on too much experiences and principles while younger people think more creative. Thinking out of the box helps people to live a better life because they do not have too much use prejudice to evaluate and make decisions. Therefore these people not following rules always can experience some surprises and live a more colourful life. So in my point of view it’s clear that the younger will enjoy more than the older ones.
73,3,TASK1: ABOUT ALTRUISMAltruism is completely opposite to selfishness. Meerkat animal is use to sacrifice itself for its group an individual acts as a sentinel in order to protect the other members. once it come to know the danger which is going to happen it simply gives a signal to its group and flees as soon as possible into the burrow the remaining group may scatter suddenly or come together to battle against the enemy not only in the animals even in human beings altruism is found they are many people who are very kind and helpful in nature they help a lot of people even to the strangers examples like blood donors organ donors etc. to unknown persons. Even though they won’t get any appreciation do you think they doesn’t deserve it doesn’t matter the type of help they do they are very kind hearted towards other people at least for that they have to be appreciated the awards or appreciation may be non-material but they have to thanked for something for what they have did.TASK2: ADULTS SHOULD STAY WITH PARENTS OR BE INDEPENDENTMy stand on this particular topic is neutral because there are pros and cons on both the sides children want independence from their parents in order to explore their dreams they don’t want to be guided because they think they are good enough in handling situations and contemporary to that parents are also allow their child’s to such type of situations because they want their children to what exactly life is and how it is going to create hurdles in the progress of career.This is only on the one side of the coin the remaining people want to live with their families due to effective or they need their assistance etc. and parents also want their children to be with them due to many reasons there are pros and cons for both the choices if we move with the pros in the independence from the parents children are free from parental pressure and they can explore what they want and can achieve what they want without any barriers. In the cons you will have many reasons like if the adults are away from parents they may tilt towards many wrong directions and may end up with different problems.Coming to the aspect of staying with their parents they may be restricted to some levels where they cannot explore what they want to do in the life it may lead to serious mental depression which may lead to serious problems. Many adults are still facing the issues with their parents if there is no flexibility with their parents then it is not a good option to be with the parents because it may hurt him and his family and at the same time if a guy is not having any sought of goal in their life and if he is prone to bad things in his life.So it depends on the personality of the adult whether to be or not be with the parents

73,6,MODULE : When i was searching some career websites this week i noticed that your company has a lookout for an intern this summer. The position sounds great. Can you call me back and email and inform me about the application process.
74,1,According to the passage Professors are usually present in universitiesclassroomsand they are found doing some research and lecturing students. And not only as a lectures in universities they even appear in televisions as guests to talk about important topics and to give more information or knowledge about the things around the world. There are both advantages and disadvantages to the professors by doing so.Firstly coming to the advantages professors will acquire reputation when they appear on television because there will be more number of viewers in front of television when compared to a classroom even the university in which the professor teaches also gains fame then finally improved fame can increase the donation and funds to universities. Not only the professors and universities but also people will get benifitedbecause they will come know many thing which they don’t know they will acquire more knowledge by interacting with professors on television directly.Secondly coming to the disadvantages professors who appear in the television are mostly not allowed to highly educational meetings. And also people have perception that professors do it for money. And the professors won’t get enough time to teach in the institutions. Finally the public will also not be much benefited because the TV channels only want professors to speak brief about any topic so public won’t get total clarity on the topic.And with a conclusion that professors who appear on the TV will have advantages as well as disadvantages.

74,16,Opinion mostly depends on the surroundings and in the culture we are grown in. For example if we consider other American and European countries young people mostly don’t live with their parents they value more for their independence but coming to Asians countries mostly in India we value our relationships.There are many reasons why many young people want to stay with their parents the main reason is that they want to support their family and parents when they become old But people who live their family lack their individuality and freedom. So some people choose to live their own lies to enjoy the freedom.When people live away from their family they lack the moral support from the family members. Staying away from will have both advantages and disadvantages in my opinion that there are more advantages compared to the disadvantages. On the other hand when people stay away from the family they will be exposed to bad companies which will lead them to bad habits and destroy their career. Altruism is the opposite of selfishness if it is an animal or an individual performing altruism gain nothing for themselves. Altruism abounds both among humans and other mammals. Sharing of food with strangers donation of body organs to family members and even to strangers come under altruism acts. Not only humans perform altruism in fact many species of animals appear willing to sacrifice food or even their life to assist other members of their group. We can take meerkatas an example meerkat is an mammal which lives in grassland areas of Africa In the group of meerkatsan individual acts as a sentinel standing guard and looking out for predators while others hunt for food or eat food they have obtained. Even it acts as a standing guard when meerkat sees a predator such as hawk it gives an alarm cry alert to make other meerkats to run and seek shelter by altruism acts meerkat gains nothing instead it places itself in the grave danger. So the altruistic behaviour helps ensure the survival of other members in the group.
74,2,Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?If I want to go on a vacation I would choose Kerala which is in southern part of India. When I was in my 7th standard my best friend went to Kerala tour with her family she came back and described kerala in such a way that I was really mesmerized.From that day kerala has become my dream vacation to go.I was attracted to that place because I really like greenery and I am basically nature lover.I have read in many articles that kerala is one of the greenest place in the world.There ary many number of beautiful lakes and ponds present in kerala which makes kerala more special.Kerala is also known as God’s own land.Oman is kerala famous festivalwhich is celebrated with beautiful lights across tha state kerala looks more beautiful in the month of onam.I wish I would visit kerala in month of onam.Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer.According to my point of view school day should not be longer because it affects the sport practices. Others may think that by increasing the school day longer students will get more time to study but the fact is that when the study hours are increased students tend to lose their interest in studieswhen the study hours are continues without any break or without any sports hours students get frustrated.Scientists have proven that students participating in sports and in other activities tend to have more interest even in studies.If students spent most of the time in school then when they are going to spend time with family members.Even family values are important for the students to development themselves. When school hours are increased students get more stressed and when they come back to home they lose interest in everything and they feel depressed.I conclude by saying that students are not machines to work or study longer so study hours should not be longer.Orange Movie Intro:Orange movie is one of my favourite movies with a feel good story and also feel good scenes.The intro scene starts with hero portraying the picture of heroine on the wall and explaining his love story to the cop who came to stop hima song starts playing along with intro scene. In the scene he explains how he met his girlfriend with some emotional moments that play on screen make us feel soothing to see.Gajini Movie Intro :One fine morning hero wakes up slowly and goes towards wash room in a confused state.He slowly opens the door and enters into washroomhe sees some message written on the mirrorthe words are “REMOVE THE SHIRT”then he removes the shirt then he sees “Revenge” message written on his body.Then he observers many tattoos on his boby then he remembers his flashback and gets emotional and frustrated at the same time.I really like this scenethis looks very different and innovative.

74,9,The day in my college starts with waking at 7:30 am it is hard to me to get up at that time and start my day. I rush to mess in order to have my breakfast and again rush to college before 8:30 am in order to get attendance. I start my college day by selecting a particular topic and start doing boring programmes till afternoon then I  go to mess to have lunch along with my friends that one hour time is the only time I spend happily with my friends from morning.              Again after coming back to college after completion of my lunch I sit before my laptop and listen to songs and some entertaining stuff for some time and continue with programming. At 5'O clock I attend soft skills where there will be some interaction with soft skills mentor. My college have a special feature called “learning and doing” where we have to learn on our own there will be mentors to clarify doubts of students. There will be exams daily in the morning so after 6’O clock in the evening I prepare for the tomorrows exam. Then I will go to sleep after completion of my preparation for tomorrow’s exam. This is a typical day in MSIT which is boring but we will have a satisfaction that we are learning something new every day.
75,1,The lecture on Altruism is completely opposing the ideology of passage. The speaker initiates in her lecture saying the new findings always makes us re-examines and quotes the example of Meerkat. Meerkat is a species found on grasslands of Africa in which one of Meerkats stands as guard to indicate predicate arrival. The orator feels that guard Meerkat would have its stomach full before guarding while in passage the author mentions that Meerkat would have empty stomach it would gain nothing but others are in search of food. Secondly during lecture the lady feels guard can easily escape from predators like hawk as it stands near burrow the danger call that it gives to the group may draw the attention and the group might be attacked which is in contradiction of the passage. In passage sentinal Meerkat is more liable to risk compared to others as it’s all alone while others are in group. In the same way speaker feels that even humans donate their organs for non-materialistic appreciation which is more valuable but passage states that donation is completely selfless act which they perform for their personal satisfaction however they may receive little reward. Therefore we may conclude that passage and lecture are completely differing in their ideology.Living away from parents for certain period in life will definitely fetch better experiences helps you to learn how to deal with different people doing our own tasks without anyone’s help have self control. However I suggest this must be only for certain span in our life because parents will be happy and satisfied when their children are with them in their later part of life. Coming out of comfort knowing the how brutal the world is!! is essential in everyone’s life. Staying away from the people who guard makes you learn how to protect yourself to be independent and to learn beautiful roses have thones but at the same time but must be restricted to certain time. Enjoying with friends weekend parties having fun may be fascinating in the beginning but very soon everyone have their family to look after you are left alone when it comes to choose between you and their family. So family especially parents must never be ignored they are with you no matter what. They neither judge you with your success nor leave if you are a loser. They just love the way you are. Therefore I suggest enjoy with friends stay away from home for a while to get experience of how to manage things alone but don’t leave family forever take up the responsibilities when you have to and be an asset to your family.
75,10,"The speaker in the lecture is mainly about real benefits of a professor attending the TV shows which is completely opposing the idea in passage. Firstly the speaker says its neither advantageous to professor nor audience. The students or the university dont get benefitted by this. Coming to professor he may not get inivitation to any of the important desicions considering him not serious about research.He may not get funds for research. He may gain reputation among fellow professors but that would be definitely in negative way.It may result in lot of time being wasted like time to travel get ready to shoot. However knowledgeable the professor is the audience are neither interested to listen to sophisticated deeper insight of the topic nor in the complete analysis audience just require brief entertaining content which a TV reporter can give.But in the passage its completely in contradiction. The author here admits that professor gains reputationhe gets satisfied for enlightening the public with his speech. The people outside the narrow world of education would know about the topic. Coming to students and unversity according to the speech they are ultimate loser as the professor may not find time to them as he would be busy with shooting schedules which is completely in disagreement to audio.In audio the orator said the university is benefited the most as viewers believe that university has knowledgeable faculty which in turn increases donationsmore applications from potential students. Therefore I conclude that passage and the audio differ completely in ideology. I like age is never a hurdle to enjoy when you are ready to take things as they come in life. In matter what if you are prepared to take the challenge then everything is fun. However when I should choose between young or old then I go with the statement ""Young people enjoy life more than Old people."" I would like to support the statemnet with following points. Firstly Young people are energetic healthy unlike Old people. Young ones love to take up challanges they can do lot of things independently. I feel its the time of achieve get successful in lifeplanning for future. Usually all the critical moments life turning decisions are taken below fourty. The rest of the life depends on decisions taken before risks or challenges faced. What kind of stream we opt for what place you want to be in another five years what kind of company do you want to for what kind of boy that you want to marry with... these descisions are taken when we are young and that changes our life. We enjoy alot when we are at school.Child-like behaviour in combination with innocence results in great fun. There is no place for egono room for grudgeno thought for animosity the only thing we know is to chill with friends and enjoying with family.Slowly when we get into college bunking to classes hangouts with friends watching movies again having fun. Later we get serious in our life and thats another kind of fun we going to have thats taking up challenges getting placed in reputated company earning bread for ourselves. Thats the fantastic feeling one may have. Later getting married to the whom we love which is another amazing feeling. No doubt we would be happy in later part of the life also but the real enjoyment is at earlier part of life."

76,1,Altruism is a type of behavior in which an animal sacrifices its own interest for that of another anima or group of animals. Altruism is the opposite of selfishness: individuals performing altruistic acts gain nothing for themselves. Examples of altruism abound both among humans and among other mammals. Unselfish acts among humans range from the sharing of food with strangers to the donation of body organs to family members and even to strangers. Such acts are altruistic in that they benefit another yet provide little reward to the one performing the act.In fact many species of animals appear willing to sacrifice food or even their life to assist other members of their group. The meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa is often cited as an example. in groups of meerkats an individual acts as a sentinel standing guard and looking out for predators while the others hut for food or eat food they have obtained. If the sentinel meerkat seems a predator such as a hawk approaching the group .it gives alarm cry alerting the other meerkats to rum and to rum and seek shelter. By standing guard the sentinel meerkat gains nothing –it goes without food while the others eat and it places itself in grave danger. After it issues an alarm it has to flee alone which might make it more at risk to a predator since animals in groups are often able to work together to fend off a predator. So the altruistic sentinel behavior helps ensure the survival of other members of the meerkats group.In these day of course some young adults want independence from their parents and some other young adults prefer to live with their families for a long time. Both are individual and have separate reasons.Let go with wanted people they deals individual interests and own decisions about any works. They never consider family interaction in any topic; they prefer more temporary interactions with others and they feel alone when with family Let comes to young adults who prefer family interaction; they may be bound with responsibilities. Because they think happiness is only with family. By birth they live with family.In my opinion staying with family is best because family is first school of learning .in family every interaction can give happiness.

76,12,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.Yes young people enjoy life more than older people because they have age potential courage and also support of parents. But in case older they have no age not enough potential and they are support to their families. Younger people not have more responsibilities when compare with older one. There is no need of doing job for younger people if they have economically potential parents. If they doing any kind of job there is no need for asking money from parents. But in case of older one they treat themselves as second to spend money and give first choice to family .So there is social responsibility to fulfill for enjoy of older people. And older people need to work daily when compare to young people. Because they need to fulfill the family responsibilities. But in some cases the older people enjoy lot than younger people for example at the time of fulfillment their responsibility. This kind of enjoy can be happen with age and when taking responsibility. This special for older people. In my point of view the enjoy is different for older people and younger people according to age. But in case of older people they already cross younger age group so they already enjoy while younger .the younger people enjoy is not comparable with older people. Because the older people enjoyment show there age and they enjoy based on their age group.

If I could go on vacation I would go to Italy. Because it is best tourist place and have many historical buildings. Most of these build by ancient Romans. The Colosseum is an historical architecture in Rome “which is capital of Italy”. It is built to entertain the Romans by conducting games. It is one of the world wonders. It is a symbol of roman architecture and several soldier deaths. In Colosseum bloody fights are conducted that’s wise several soldiers dead. The fighters are called by a name Gladiater. Italy surrounded by a sea shore and mountains. These create a separate attention of visitors. These visitors can visit Vatican City because Vatican City centered in Italy and nearer to Rome city. Everyone know Vatican City is Christen religious place and the POPE stay there. There is an idiom on Rome city called “when you are in Rome be like a Roman”. Italy not only famous for Rome city. There are verity places to visit like Venice. This city is built on water and it famous for shipping from ancient time. Mostly every newly married couple prefers their honeymoon in this city only. The boating yard is famous for races and movie shooting. In Italy there is another city named Sicily which famous for trading business and fishing. It is an island. There are some more islands in Italy and famous as tourist spots. Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer.In student life every movement is a stone of his future because student first actual interaction with society starts in school days and builds his character. Any decision about student life will affect the student future. So the decision should be proper.While coming to school long hours both sides are right according to their views. But there is a point that student need both studies and sports simultaneously. So if we go with anyone it effect student concentration which is very important factor student should have. In Any School there are two variety students will there. First is not interest to spend more time in school. Second is interest to spend more time in school. These may be interested in sports or studies or both. So if we support longer hours it will be bad based on the student interest about longer hours in school. In my point of view longer day is not needed. If school board want place longer school day. It is better to place half week normal hours and another half week longer hours. This implementation is only for higher classes not for lower classes. Because the higher class students are able to understand than lower class students. Mostly higher class students needed more time on studies.

77,11,TASK-1Professors are normally found guest on tv news programmes commentary on latest events. They benefit from appearing on television because they acquire the reputations but it is not good thing. They can improve reputations but there is a lot of wastage of time for reharsing travel timethey entertain rather than profession. But in research there is no wastage of time. Professors will get only reputation but for universities they will get the appearance of the college and positive publicity to the university.The improved reputation in turn leads to more donations for the university more applications for students. So the university will benefit more with the appearance of professor in the TV. Professors tell about the academic titles current trends and historical while appearing on TV. They appear on TV only for the increase of their reputation.But sometimes it helps to a lot of people because everyone will watch TV and know about current trends and share their ideas with the audiencethe professors importance as scholars is enhanced Television is generally a medium for commentary that tends to be superficial not deep or thoughtful. TASK-2I will agree with the young people will enjoy more than old people. Young people have a lot of enjoyment. They can go anywhere any time. But old people cannot because the stamina will be decreased by growing older. They cannot do a lot of work as young people do. Young people will enjoy with the technology by using day to day life. The old one did not know the usage of the technology. They are missing the usage of technology which helps a lot.For Example Now a days everyone is using laptops and mobiles along with the internet. But old people where not using it. If we ask them to learn the usage of it they will not show the intrest on it. They will say that it is not necessary to us as we are growing old.Old people will go on usage of old technology what they have used previously. They will not change with the current trends which makes our life easier. Young people can do a lot of work when compared to the old people because the strength for old people will go on decreasing while the age increases.Young people will have lot of enjoyment with the friends when compared to the old people. Young will crack jokes on friends playing with them and will have a lot of enjoy. Old people will also have friends but they mostly talk about the life and there is no enjoyment. But old people have seriousness on their life when compare to the young people. Young people will concentrate on the enjoyment and have seriousness in their career. But less when compared to old people. Young people build their career along with the enjoyment.So I conclude that young people have more enjoyment when compare to the old people.

77,16,Task-1 Writing Based on Reading and ListeningProfessors are normally found in the University classrooms offices and libraries doing research and lecturing to their students. Now a days professors are appearing in the television instead of in the classrooms because they acquire reputations as authorities in their academic fields.Appearing in the television will increase their reputation but there is a lot of professor time was waste. The time will be wasted to professor because of preparing the notes for appearing in the television and doing the rehearsals.Universities also benefit from such appearances and receive a positive publicity when professors appear on TV. The reputation of University turn leads to more donations and more applications from potential students.Professor appear on TV will have entertain rather than learning. There will be a waste of time in appearing on TV instead they can do their research and help to the students.Television viewers normally have no contact with university professors but by appear on TV there is a chance to learn from experts and exposed to views. Professors are appearing on TV just for the reputation and to get their authorities in their fields.Young People Enjoy life more than older people do. I agree with the following statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people. It is because Young people can do anything what they what but old people cannot. By growing old stamina will be decreased and there will be no interest to enjoy. They think that they want to take rest instead of enjoying. Young people will learn new things with the changes appearing in the world But old people doesn’t have any interest to learn new things. Every person should change according to the changes appearing in the world. Old people doesn’t change with the situations so they cannot enjoy their life. Young people will have a lot of enjoyment with their friends and families. Older people will enjoy with their family instead of enjoying with the both family and friends. They think that it’s enough to enjoy with their family the remaining life but it’s wrong with the friends we can share our happiness and sadness. Young people can go anywhere that may be different states and countries and they will enjoy a lot. Old people will also go to different places but the enjoyment will be very less when compared to the young people. Young people will enjoy more when compared to old people with family and friends.

77,6,A Restarant Owner or manager.A wedding reception.Late at nightSomething embarrassing has happened.It was 8pm in night all were busy in having Dinner in a wedding Reception .The restaurant Owner was very tensed because of food made by his workers were not satisfactory. All of a sudden he heard a loud sound made by one of his workers he had tense full expression on his face and says to the Owner that food wasn’t no that much satisfactory so they called him to give a reason. He was going in a hurry to give reasons for the questions which would be asked by the wedding people. Suddenly he heard that again someone was in way to call him .He turned back! he saw a old man with white Trouser and shirt who was shouting his name in order to stop him to go to answer the question. He says that the varieties you made were tasty and exhibits our troubles in making it but it just lakes some spices in some of the dishes. He also advices him to say them that in marriage this type of mistakes will not happen. The Owner of the restaurant felt happy for it.He goes and convinces all the marriage people all were convinced with the behavioural attitude exhibited by him. If he doesn’t know the feedback of the people he would have addressed in another way where their could be no hope in convincing them. So it made him to think that something embarrassing had happened in order to save him for the troubles. So by this I conclude that “mistakes will happen in our life but try to know them and rectify but don’t let them be hurdles in all the steps of your life”.

While he was explaining about the company many thoughts are running in my mind. In the middle of speech suddenly he asked me to speak about my view towards company. I was shocked and later I have given a brief description about it and relaxed. Later he explained about the selection process. There was a written test followed by HR round. The written test is toughest round than HR round. He clearly said that it was hard to clear. Then I felt that it could be harder for me to qualify the test. Finally with my hard work I was able to attend HR round. Interviews are going around and I was waiting for my chance to attend HR round. Everyone’s face were filled with tension.

78,4,All large software development projects irrespective of application generate a large amount of associated documentation. For moderately sized systems the documentation will probably fill several filing cabinets; for large systems it may fill several rooms. A high proportion of software process costs is incurred in producing this documentation. Furthermore documentation errors and omissions can lead to errors by end-users and consequent system failures with their associated costs and disruption. Therefore managers and software engineers should pay as much attention to documentation and its associated costs as to the development of the software itself. Process documentationProduct documentation.Process documentation These documents record the process of development and maintenance. Plans schedules process quality documents and organizational and project standards are processThe major characteristic of process documentation is that most of it becomes outdated. Plans may be drawn up on a weekly fortnightly or monthly basis. Progress will normally be reported weekly. Memos record thoughts ideas and intentions which change.5. Working papers These are often the principal technical communication documents in a project. They record the ideas and thoughts of the engineers working on the project are interim versions of product documentation describe implementation strategies and set out problems which have been identified.

78,8,From the reading passage we get to know that professors benefit a lot when they appear on T.V Like as follows The university and the professor’s reputation will increase because of the TV appearanceMore number of students join the university . Whereas the lecture tells us that the professors face a lot of problems because of TV appearance like as follows.The professors may not be able to attend conferences because of his/her TV appearances.The professors may use most of his time for TV rehearsals and presentations which can be used for clearing students doubts and for their research purposeThe professors may not be invited to important academic meetings.In the passage it’s given that because of TV appearance the professors ideas and knowledge reaches wide number of people compare to academic students.But in the lecture it is given that in TV appearance the professors cannot deliver the in-depth topic to audience as they will have limited time to convey their ideas.
79,1,In the lecture the professor’s view on appearing on television is not beneficial for both university and the public. The reasons that she stated are belowIf a professor is not a serious researcher he will do entertainment on television instead of a class.It is a lot of tome waste to the professor. He should spend a lot of time on makeup travelling preparing for the lecture and rehearsal of the lecture.It is also a problem to the university because the professor is spending valuable time on television rather than in the university.If he delivers a lecture on TV then the audience don’t understand in depth concepts. The just look at the title of the work.The information provided by the professor is a historical facts and analysis of the topic. It is same to the script of a journalist who does a little home work.But in the passage it was contradicted that these lectures can benefit the public and increase the reputation of the professor. It can also attract many students to join the university. If a lecture was given in a college journal only other scholars will learn. But if it was given on TV then even public knows a lot.As a coin has two faces both young people and older people enjoy their life and struggle as well.If we consider the case of younger people on one side of the coin they enjoy a lot. They can play games go to movies and eat whatever they want without any restrictions. They can go out for parties etc. But the enjoyment is not limited only to parties and movies. They can also be with loved ones. Life looks beautiful as they have a lot of strength and time. On the other side of the coin at this age some of the younger generation struggle a lot because of the stress put on them by their parents. Their career related problems and financial problems etc.If we consider the case of older people on one side of a coin they have experienced a lot of hurdles they worked hard for their children and establishing a good career to their children. They worked day and night to build a dream home and finally they retire from all these responsibilities and enjoy their rest of life happily playing with their grand children. On the other side of the coin if the older people have no support after they get old they find it difficult to manage. They can’t eat everything because of the health restrictions. Many suffer from health problems. If they are not loved by their children they will literally see a hell spending their lives in old age homes. Finally I would like to conclude that both the young age people and old age people have many joyful moments and also a lot of struggles. If one simply don’t get stuck at a point in life and just keep going on then everyone will enjoy their life irrespective of their age.

79,12,In the lecture the professor spoke about altruism.She stated the example of Meerkuts a kind of animals which live in the grasslands of Africa. She told that there is a sentinel meerkut which guards the group.Before going to guard they have stomach full of food. But other animals which hunt for food stay with hunger. When a predator is approaching it makes an alarm. Since it is nearer to the burrow it escapes immediately by going into the burrow. But the sound it makes leaves the other animals in danger.It sees for its own survival at the cost of lives of other animals.Some altruists donate their kidneys expecting for nothing.But they will return some appreciation or reward in return.Facts stated in the passage/The sentinel meerkut doesn’t have a meal before it goes for guard while all other animals are in search of food. So the sentinel has to suffer from humger. Also when a predator is observed by the sentinel meerkut it makes an alarm for the other meeerkuts to be alert and escape. But the sound made by the sentinel leaves it in danger. It may be targeted by the predator and sometimes it may also die.The professor actually opposed many facts which are stated in the passage. In the passage the sentinel meerkut was stated as an altruist which scrifices its life for the sake of others. But in the lecture given by the professor he stated the guard meerkut as a selfish animal leaving its grouop in danger
79,2,Question 1:Title: The Legend of Bhagat Singh.Why: The Titles are given with the agitations of people and speeches of great leaders. After the titles are finished in the opening scene a group of people are doing agitations in front of the jail. They praise Bhagat Singh. Meanwhile at the backside of the jail the police breaks the wall and moves three dead bodies from jail in a van. They stop a river bank and slice the bodies into pieces and burn them with petrol. The public knew this and rushed towards the area. The three dead bodies are Bhagat Singh SukhDev and RajGuru.

The best way to get out of this routine work is to go out for a vacation. Whenever I feel tired of my daily routine I prefer to go on a vacation. Do you know that going on a vacation reduces your stress and makes you refreshed? But it happens only when you forget your mobile.... My favourite holiday spot is Darjeeling. Darjeeling is located in Shimla just below the great Himalayan Range. It is one of the best pilgrimage destinations. It is well known for its pleasant climate and beautiful landscapes. The morning in Darjeeling is a wonderful sight. The entire landscape is covered with fog. It has various places to explore. Moreover it is famous for different varieties of tea and medicinal herbs. The Darjeeling tea estates are very beautiful to look at. We can enjoy our day with the dances and performances of the local tribes. Their food varieties are just awesome. For those who are trying to escape out of this polluted environment and want to refresh yourself and escape from this hot temperatures Darjeeling is the best place.Essay 2: Opinion on the school decision Now a days parents and schools concentrate mainly on studies and bypass sports and extracurricular activities. Studies are important for our career but even sports have an equal weightage in one’s life. Classroom activities assignments science and math are required for a child. But they should not be forced. An interest should be created in the child. This interest comes out of a peaceful and happy mind. Sports and other hobbies help a child to develop himself beyond education. Moreover sports makes one’s mind very active and stress free which can again create interest in studies. So education is important but without sports it is useless. It doesn’t make a perfect student.

Also if they publish their work in academic journal only scholars will appreciate their views. It opposes the point that they acquire reputations as authorities in their academic fields among audience. It is very difficult for a professor to get money to do research if he appears on television. It takes a lot of time for a professor to prepare when he is going to appear on television. Apart from that travel time and getting ready to look good also consumes lot of his time. If he is at the university he may either help out his students by solving their doubts or carry out his research.The university receive positive publicity when their professors appear on TV such as they receive more donations and more applications from the students. TV networks do not want very deep theory about any academic topic. The professors just give some brief introduction about the latest events in the world. For example if a new variety of gene is found professor tells about that. If a reporter do some work then he will be able to tell without the need of professor. TASK - 2 Young people enjoy life more than old people doThe people who are young are very busy in their daily routine. These days they can’t even find time to hang out with their families especially working people. The people who are studying enjoy the most. A person can enjoy at every part of their life. One who loves studying enjoys that. A person who loves working enjoy his work. In the same way when a person loves what he is doing he will definitely enjoy. Irrespective of the age a person will enjoy what he do.In some situations young people enjoy more when compared to the old. In situations like hanging out with friends till late nights. Even old can do that but they must be conscious about their health as they are growing older. Hanging out till late night is not good for their health and it may leads to many disorders.Apart from the physical enjoyment a person can also enjoy mentally. Most of the times old people will recollect their memories and enjoy. It is also a kind of enjoyment. Our mental condition matters more when compared with the physical condition. So it is not that young can enjoy more than old both young and old can enjoy equally.

8,13,WRITING TASK-2Some young adults may feel that they need independence from their parents as soon as possible. But I prefer to stay with family longer as I think it’s more better than moving out of the house and staying at other place.Also there are two ways in which adults think to stay away from the parents may be either positive or negative. Some may feel that their family is just like a hurdle for their life and others may feel that they will come to know about the responsibilities and problems which one can face if they lead a single life.However I always prefer to live with family. Being with family is like living in heaven. Whatever the problems we get we do have many people around us to solve those and give us good suggestions and many other live examples which they have faced in their life. Becoming adult doesn’t mean that a person is totally matured but just grownup. Till we attain a certain age one need to stay with the family.Family gives a good support and it’s the only strength for us which we couldn’t find anywhere else. In all the aspects such as studies money status etc. family gives us a good reputation. The name and fame of a person depends upon the family in which that person was born sometimes. In some situations there may be need to work late nights. Now the technology has grown very well and one can reach home at any time even by booking a cab. Till few years before we do not have such technology and female were in trouble. In that situation if they live with their parents they will help her by receiving her or by going to the place where she was and picking her. Not only in the case of female but also for male family gives a good support. They provide us whatever we want and help us in every aspect. Even in doing our works they help us a lot.Finally I could say that till a person is capable to know about his responsibilities staying or living with family is a good option.

8,9,TASK-1Julian Treasure a sound and communication expert is a top rated international (TED) speaker and “How to speak so that people want to listen” is one of the top twenty TED talks of all the time. In this talk he speaks not only about different senses of speaking to be avoided but also about the powerful foundations that are required while one speak.There are seven deadly senses of speaking that every person need to avoid. They are:Gossip.Judging.Negativity.Complaining.Excuses.Exaggeration.Dogmatism.Gossiping is nothing but talking about a person who is not present which is not a good habit. Judging a person is very hard because in order to judge a person one must listen to his/her speech very carefully. Also it is very hard for a person to listen if he knows that he is going to be judged by other person. Negativity complaining and excuses are also to be avoided. One must never exaggerate sometimes it may lead to lying. Dogmatism is confusing of facts with opinions.There are four powerful foundations to be followed “HAIL”. H-HonestyA-AuthenticityI-Integrity and L-LoveOne must be straight and clear enough absolute honesty is not required at some times. Be yourself and maintain your word while delivering your speech. Finally wish everybody well with Love.Julian Treasure also mentioned about 6 exercises for arms lips tongue and making sound(v-o) which he usually perform before delivering a speech to a gathering. Finally he conclude that speaking powerfully to people who are listening carefully in an environment which actually fit for sounds beautiful and understanding will be the norm.
80,1,Ruby Molly MathewsIITH-105ESSAYAdults the ones who have just completed their rebellious phase of life and have stepped into sanity to an extent. They either have boiling blood or glitter running through their veins with a determination to rattle the stars to achieve what they want in life.Perspective of every individual changes in every area once he stones adulthood he gets clarity in life and speaks sense to an extent. His scenarios and circumstances during his period of growth would make him more attached or detached from family his battles would have either made him a warrior for good or would have shattered him into pieces for bad.According to me living with family is the best choice. Family they are the ones who have seen you fly seen you fall picked you up when you were low stood by you in every battle yet never lost faith in you they have been a part of all your high and low tides of life. They don’t succumb you to things nor do they get sarcastic with you infact they only get all the more encouraging to make you reach heights in life. Family always stands as a spine to see you stand tall in all situations as a shield from all . They definetly play a huge role in chistling you to a masterpiece that you are today they help you carve a nitch for yourself their support definetly leave an indelible mark in the sands of time.What more good would it be than waking up next to such a beautiful blessing every dawnWe need to treasure them and every moment with them instead of taking family for granted they alone are the precious ones who will quench our thirst to meaning of life for indeed they add a whole new meaning to life Family indeed makes you a better person to make this world a better place to live in.Ruby Molly MathewsIITH-105SUMMARYAltruism is an audacious act of being unselfish and generous in the acts one does regardless of being petrified of the consequences they have to face. This is a very suave method of doing good for your fellow men indeed an antonym to all bad virtues. Altruistic beings are meticulous virtuosos in their good acts of divinity.Paragons of Altruism are prevelant among human beings and animals among human beings by donating body organs and blood. Among animals altruism is seen amidst meerkats that live in grassland burrows of Africa the senital meerkat stands as a guard of safety while other meerkats are in the burrow he keeps watch over the predator and alarms his fellowmate as soon as he sees the predator arriving towards them for this kind act they either receive a little award or hardly receive anything.Such altruistic individuals are even ready to share or give away their food or shelter to their fellow mates without expecting to receive anything in return. These beings indeed have a very suave mannerism in all their acts of living. They never feel squavished or apprehensive to endanger their life to any extent to save the other.Amidst human beings or mammals there are high chances of risking ones life as well in the process of doing for the otherthe senital meerkat stands as an example to this while he alerts his crowd he endangers his own life at first being a shield of defence to his people.

81,1,Problem Set 1: Introductions in EssaysPlease answer these questions in a separate word document and upload the document on the submission link provided outside this lesson.QUESTION 1:A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie. List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them.Format:MOVIE TITLE: Terminator- Judgment Day Dragon Ball Z WHY: Movies are another form of transition world where they take you to an alternate world and make you feel like living in it. This can be happened only if the opening sequence of the film is made interesting. In Terminator- Judgment day the movie starts off with a dark tone of music where a man comes from the past to the present timeline to fulfill his mission. Also in Dragon Ball Z the movie starts of a dream sequence where an enemy who is dead is raised by his soldiers with a high background music which gets followed by the movie title. As these concepts where never been approached the audience gets easily involved so was for me as a great memorable opening sequence. QUESTION 2:1.    Read the following essay prompts and write a suitable introductory paragraph for each of them using the 3 elements of introduction - hook orient readers and key terms:Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why? Ans) Switzerland is one of the few countries in the world which is rich in culture heritage and wealth. It is quite known for “the city of chocolates” and for its ski resorts. In my opinion I would like to go to Switzerland on the vacation mainly for skiing and sky diving. Additionally I would love to buy and eat the chocolates over there.Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer.Ans) School is a place for both learning and physical activity. Children spending time on studying without physical activity would get only knowledge but their body would become lazy. To avoid this scenario In my opinion I believe that teachers must give equal importance to both studying and sport activities.

81,14,Nowadays television has become an excellent communication medium for gathering useful information. Especially to know about facts or any truths. Professors from different Universities are also appearing on televisions to publish themselves or their respective universities and also give expert commentary on latest events around the world. Comparing both the lecture and the passage there are a lot of differences and oppositions. Firstly in the passage there are views that the professor is profited and also gets respect among fellow scholars but it is totally opposed in the lecture saying that they are only benefited internally. Secondly by appearing on the televisions they will be able to manage the timings of their schedule by losing their important meetings and also not getting enough funds from the university for their research becoming a total disadvantage. Thereby while attending the television sets and giving expertise advices to the audience the professors would also need to prepare for the topic travel a lot of distance also have a makeup for the show which all leads to the wastage of the time. Therefore even if the professors try to give detailed expertise on their topics the audience need only brief introduction to the topic not the deep lecture.In conclusion compared to the lecture and passage the professors on television by contrast get heavily drawbacks and waste a lot of time thinking of self-benefits but internally there are only losses.Young People enjoy their life more than old people do…Many of them may think that older people enjoy life more than young people do. But according to my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do. Younger generation which is often called as youth has more passion and energy which internally is the base for enjoying the life. Firstly the younger generation is free from any responsibilities or the tension of work. For instance older people have many responsibilities like to take care of their children to complete their work to earn money. These responsibilities mainly stop them from enjoying their life. Moreover when they try to enjoy their life they prefer their children first. All of these factors make them enjoy less compared to the youth. On the other hand young people do not have any responsibilities; they are free to choose from variety of options for enjoying their life. They can walk out anytime; they can go the most recent movie play anytime etc.Additionally young people are more energetic towards anything. On the other hand older generation usually go through some disabilities by the time is passing. For instance I and my elder brother live in village and usually we try to come together whenever we find some free time. And every time we go different places and try new things. But during this spring break we want our mom to join us. But unfortunately she has knees problem even since she was 45 years old which in course forces us to change our decisions and find some other time to meet. Hence we can see that by the time we start to enjoy our life terms will change up to our ages.To sum up there is a massive difference between young and older people to enjoy their life. But even the older generation can also enjoy their life according to their new age. But at some point of the time they feel they are not able to do everything they wanted to and at that time they feel that something is opposing them. On the flip side younger people will be able to enjoy life by being more energetic and less responsible.

84,3,Amidst the incomprehensible buzz of the absent minded consumers and the mind numbing advertisements there was just a subtle wave of sweet swift violin emerging from a corner. The corner was flooded by impatient people waiting for their turn. As the noise grew the corner started attracting more crowd. People rushed to the spot trying to reach the corner before any other so that they don’t have to wait longer for their turn. All they could see while approaching was a faded top hat of an old tall weather-beaten violinist swinging to and fro with his bow. Now he was an old but talented violinist the best of the Reed college jazz band back in the 1980’s. The musician was best known for his work “The seasons” which depicted the change through the duration of all the seasons with the beauty of his composition. He was often seen in the college campus sometimes trying to depict the twists and turns the leaves take during the fall or the rage and aggression of the storm with his music. A popular myth among the college students told “He was the one who bought summer to the campus after the God’s cursed this no land with forever winter.” As the crowd grew the violinist slipped into a dream recollecting the artistic beauty of Jazz he experienced during the days he spent with his fellow artists. As the crowd impatiently waited eventually the security from the ATM at the corner put out a notice which said “No cash.” Slowly the crowd started dissipating with a sense of despair on their faces. As the violinist saw this he strung the high minor note on the violin with a sense of ‘lost and found’ of losing the attention but finding peace reminiscing on how things changed.
84,4,Altruism. Altruism is an act of selflessness usually seen in mammals living in communities done for the benefit of the community or other individuals and not necessarily for the advantage of the individual doing it. Typical altruistic behaviour involves helping the other individuals of community without any return benefits. The behaviour study on meerkat’s living in communities found that sometimes one individual called the sentinel moves out of the group and guards the group while they are busy looking for food or while eating. In case of emergencies the sentinel would signal it out loud to the group to alert them so that they hide out in the burrows. Important thing to notice here is that the meerkat is more prone to be seen by the predator while signalling the group. The sentinel risks its life in an act of altruism so that the group can go along with their activities safely. Human also tend to perform altruism but not easily at the cost of their lives. The normal acts of selflessness we see or do is donating food to the needy helping stranger with some guidance helping neighbours with moving things etc.. However This theory on Altruism isn’t entirely convincing. A recent more closer look at the meerkat sentinels found that the the expected act of selflessness isn’t actually authentic. The study found that sentinels are usually closer to their borrows and are the first to escape into safety after signalling. Usually this sentinel had already had food. So the act of selflessness we thought wasn’t exactly in sacrificing food and risking life. Also when we look into ourselves we always look for some reward or for some form of self-worth while performing these acts of altruism. Humans tend to suffice themselves with some sense of worth and entitlement while helping out strangers and neighbours in the community. Altruism isn’t totally understood for it isn’t clear if its really a selfless behaviour developed along the times of living along with the community or an act driven by self-benefit.TASK 2: Freedom from and with Family. The world is now driven on freedom of choice and liberty but many a times the liberty is misguiding. Children these days are so much conscious about their choices and demand a right to choose among several of their option given by society. But we need to understand that some of these choices hurt beyond recovery. Having said that it’s also true to say that an individual should have total freedom and responsibility to choose what he lives by. May it be the career the work the relationships etc..Living with one’s family is always good until there is mutual respect care and love among the family members. Living as a family is synonymous to living with and among a group where the state and actions of one member affect the entire group and may have bad consequences on everyone’s living.The situation where a person can live in and as a family is ideal this issue. Young adults however have the urge of breaking out of the family bond of living and aging with a group under the constraints that the group provides. The age urges the individuals to break free and flee. However they should also understand that it’s a moral responsibility of a child to take care of his parents when they are no longer capable of supporting themselves either financially of mentally.Also separating from the family would reduce the emotional bond between a person and family. Living in and along with a family can benefit people in many ways. There is always some guidance from the more experienced and the help from the few caring. There is always room for making celebrations and sharing sorrow.To summarise young adults may leave their families to live separately if they wish but they should have the moral responsibility to care for and protect their families. But if the family has no love nd respect to each other it’s not really useful to try and stick together.
84,5,Professors have taken up knowledge sharing through TV appearances and talks. However beneficial this may sound there might be bad sides to this initiative too.. One possible benefit is acquiring reputation among other professors among other universities and also in the general public. This not just helps the professor by giving him a wider regard and recognition but the particular academic field and also the particular university will also be benefited. The field would then draw funds and the university would gain reputation. While this seems as an obvious case there are certain bad effects to this too. For example the professors who make frequent TV appearances aren’t considered as serious scholars but rather an entertainer. Thus the professor might lose value among the other professors of the community and might also miss-out on the chance to attend important meetings or lectures. Also the professor himself might be at risk of losing much of his perks. The time spent on preparing the content to be published on tv converting it into the suitable format preparing and rehearsing the content might take-up much of the professors time which can be well spent in the university and on other research. Travelling and getting made-up for the TV appearance would also take up a lot of the professor’s valuable time.The lecture points out the critical view of the other professors which the passage couldn’t hint.Another benefit discussed in the passage is the benefit of the general public from the professors teaching. Now from the various TV shows the public can be at much more grip of knowledge at current events and scientific studies. But while the public is actually getting benefited there is no point in losing a professors time contributions towards research to the before-bedtime TV shoe. The show would just be another briefing on a subject which a reporter can do with proper background work. The lecture says its better to give the work to reporters rather than the professors whose time can be well spent in more innovations and research which actually is much more beneficial. Not necessarily.While it might seem that young people are capable of doing more things and are not bound by the limitations put up by the age and the growing weakness of the body this might not entirely be the case. How one enjoys life is completely dependent on oneself. Let’s take up certain instances which would justify this.Young people have the burdens of study and work. They might have to face failures live up to expectations and the competitive environment set-up career plan and proceed accordingly etc.. While the person is busy doing all these s/he would definitely miss out on enjoying. This can be argued by saying that the work we do should be enjoyable. That’s not the case with many young people. Many youngsters study and work in fields that they are not interested in because of lack of affordability and lack of chances. The happiness index of any country depends mostly on the youngsters because they are the greater proportion. Many a times the countries where the affordability relative chances of study and work for youngsters employability etc are the major factors. The countries which are not developed or are still developing show low happiness indices. This clearly states that the major proportion of the population of the country mostly youngsters is not happy.Also in a lighter sense older people have more freedom of living. Older people are economically stable and have the choice of living life their own way. While youngsters have to be bound by their goals and career perspectives older people can choose to work and live as they wish. When it comes to living happily older people can get away to happiness faster as they have much more experience. While youngsters are still figuring out what choice to be made the older people have already made the choices. They might not have the energy but they have wisdom. Ultimately happy living is all in how a person makes his living. But in a practical and broader perspective its not necessarily that young people enjoy more than the older people or the other way around.

85,10,The passage says that Altruism is a behaviour in which an animal sacrifices its own interest for that of another animal or group of animals.It is the opposite of selfishnessThe passage gives an example of Meerkat which says that in a Meerkat group a single meerkat stays as an sentinel standing guard looking out for predators while the others hunt for food or eat food they have obtained. It also says that guardian Meerkat goes without food while others eat and it places itself in danger there by hellping other Meerkats. But the lecture says that the Meerkats that are eating food in groups are in more danger than the sentinel Meerkat because the sentinel Meerkat can escape easily without much problem while the whole group is in danger from the predator. The passage says that the sentinel Meerkat gives an alarm cry by alerting other Meerkats when predator approaches as to fend off predator by working together in groups.But the lecture says that the alarm cry by sentinel Meerkat makes the group assume to meet or move where the whole group is at danger.The passage says that human are another example for Altruism .Humans donate organs without expecting the rewards . But the lecture questions saying Aren’t the rewards appreciation received by the humans worthy?

85,7,Rewriting a passageWhen I was surfing in some career websites this week I noticed that your company has a vacancy for an intern this summer. The position sounds appropriate. Can you email me the details of the application process?
85,8,Task-1: The essay is about the Professors generally appearing in a television show . Generally Professors are found in classrooms libraries and they also appear as guests on TV news programs giving expert advice . Their appearance is a great benefit to their universities and the general public . But the lecture questions whether it really benefits anybody .The passage says that professors benefit from appearing in tv shows as it gains them reputation as authorities in their academic fields among a much wider audience than they have on campus .If a professor publishes views in an academic journal only other scholar will learn about and appreciate the views and by apearing in tv shows large number of people become aware of his work and his reputation as scholar is enhanced . But the speaker contradicts saying that by appearing in the tv shows the professor cannot earn reputation from research scholars and they are not invited to conferences . The professors will not be alloted any money for their research . The passage says that universities benefit from the professor appearances on a TV and when knowledgeable member of a university appear on TV people think more highly of that university and this leads to increase in reputation of the university and more applications from potential students . The speaker contradicts saying that public will not be interested in a serious lecture after dinner . The speaker also says that generally the experts in a tv show present about prehistoric era or something that is not a lecture .Task-2: It was saturday evening I was going to company to complete work because of the project pending and my grandfather was preparing a schedule of his next tour and planning for that . I believe old people enjoy life more than young people because they are retired from their employment and usaully spend the days planning trips to several holy places and relatives house . Usually young people are employed and they usually work a whole day and come home tired not having patience for any enjoyment plans . The young people's day starts early and ends up late with emails chats and office work . The whole week is usaully spent with office work and the weekends are the only days young people can stay at home not going to office. The old people are retired from their work and tend to spend the time with family members and visit friends relatives . Old people have a lot of time spending the way they want . Young people because of their hectic shedule don't have much time to attend functions or meet friends. Old people get together with their friends and spend the happily . The family's responsibility tranfers to young people once the old people retire from work . This involves taking care of the family in terms of money and it is an extra task to be taken care by young people. The old people doesn't have this responsibility and have time to enjoy in a way they want. Young people because of family responsibility work hard and they donot have much time left to enjoy . Old people develop new habits as they have time while young people can't . A person can enjoy when he has time and people to join in the enjoyment . The young people have less time and not many young people can involve in the enjoyment as they too are employed . The old people have both time and people to enjoy their time .

87,1,WRITING TASK -1 The topic in the passage is about the professors appearance in the television. I agree with it and it was good because making the professors interact with the television audience will educate the public. The purpose of the appearance and the effect should also be noticed. The professors will observe many and different students in the Universities and colleges. So it will help him/her to interact with the budding Graduate students and will help them to know how to be a productive student. It will also help the graduate students to know the needs of the society which will improvise his/her role in the society. On the other side some of the professors will make their appearance in the television only for entertainment. The sort of appearances mentioned in the above line doesn’t have any use for the society and there will be waste in lot of time.Moreover the television appearances which are useful for the society will increase the reputation of the professor as well as the college/ University in which he is working. Nonsense television appearances will lessen the respect of the professor and also the institution from which he belong. Such type of appearances should try to educate the people in the right way because it will be watched by the whole world and it will make impact on future generation. WRITINIG TASK -2 Young people enjoy life more than older people do Yes I agree with the above statement. I support my statement because the young people will have more energy and the state of mind in the youth phase also leans towards the enjoyment. Whereas the older people have gone through that age and they will lean towards spiritual and mythological side.In the young age everybody wants to enjoy rather than being focused on the goals. They will always want to enjoy the life in the way they want to. In the process the young minds also have the fresh and creative thoughts to enjoy the life. The way they want to be makes them more excited and make them enjoy in the life. The older people have spent all their age and at that age they will feel more relaxed than in the excitement to enjoy their remaining life. Some of the people may regret their past actions in the young or middle age and they want to enjoy the remaining life. Even though some of them want to enjoy their remaining life they don’t have the energy in the young age. Many constraints like lack of physical strength and adaptability to the extremities will come into play and make them to end up in cancelling the plans. Whereas in the young age people will find the time to enjoy with the friends and colleagues as the responsibilities are less compared to other age people.I support my point by mentioning an example below. Let us consider a picnic with all groups of people. In them the young people find the different places because of keen to explore the things make them to make maximum memories. Moreover the past memories of the young people are less compared to the old people and even the little things and incidents which make them laugh and excite make them more enjoyed and thrilled.
87,10,The above passage refers to the ALTRUISM in the human beings. Altruism is the selfless acting of the person or animal. In the above passage represented the some of the human beings examples about the altruism. The one of the example to refer the altruism in human beings is about the organ donation. The humans donate their organs to their family or the other people. The organs which the required by the needy are supposed to replaced with the donor ones. In the human context the altruism signs are their helping nature without selfish acts like sharing the food to the foodless shelter to the needy and helping in the other ways.The animals also show the altruistic behaviour in some cases. The animal species mentioned in the passage is meerkat which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa. The head of the meerkat group is called as sentinel which acts as a guard to the group and warns the group on being attacked. On the warning sign all the members of the group will seek shelter and hide themselves. In this process the sentinel may get hurted by the attacking ones.But coming to some of the studies show that in the mammal species meerkats though the sentinel acts the guard it guards with the full stomach. It signs the warning cry and it goes to the shelter and first protects itself. it shows the altruism by sending the attack warning signals in this process sometimes the sentinel may also get into trouble. The essay is about the behaviour of the young adults. Some of the young adults want to be independent and doesn’t want to be with their parents. They want to be on their own.The some of the young adults want to make them prove their abilities to survive in the outer world. The persons think that they have the maturity to take the decisions about their life and build the career. Due to their immatureness in the outer world sometimes they need some moral support t to survive. Some people may survive in the outer world. But some of the young adults want to live with their parents they want to be in their parents guidance. They need to be exposed to the outer world and need to be aware of the outer world also. The young adults is the phase of life in which there is a scope of learning and doing things on their own. It also improves the adaptability skills of the person.Both of the situations are good but depending upon the situation they need to be aware of what to do. When the adults got the opportunity to go to outside and study they need to be aware of the situations in the outer world. Though they want to be independent and live independently if the are in close reach to their parents. The y should stay with their parents as they need the children support in the oldage.
87,11,My mom has influenced me the most in my life she has taught me how to be strong. She is the person you can always turn to and the person that has pushed me to always do my best. My mom was there with me all the late night sessions of homework to make sure I was satisfied with my grade. She is the kind of person that will make sure everyone else is taken care of before she is. All the sports and all the homework she has helped me make it through. Always right there next to me making sure that I was the best that I wanted to be in everything. She never pushed even though she probably wanted to but she also never let me give up on something that I was good at either. I always knew she would be there to catch me if I ever fell. She has shaped me into the person that I am today. My mom and her mother always said to me “What doesn’t kill you simply makes you stronger.” I may not always give her the best credit for everything but most of the time she seems to know what’s best.
87,2,QUESTION-2ESSAY-1 The place where I want to go on vacation is Kanyakumari. It is located at the bottom of the India in Tamilnadu State. It is the place where Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats meet at the southern tip of the Peninsular India. The reason I would like to visit Kanyakumari is to see the sunrise which is pleasant to watch and it gives impulse for me and rejuvenates my mind. The rays of the sun hitting the sea water will adds the extra color to picture which lasts for only few minutes in the day. The blue sky turns into brown colored sky and some orange spots which makes the impression of AURA. ESSAY-2 In the above discussion on the school day planning is a quite interesting topic which effects the child’s mental and physical growth. I support the idea of the shorter school day because at the age of school every child is in growing stage and more over only scheduling all the time for studies will increase the child’s stress . Making the shorter school days will help for the students spending some of the time on sports and extra-curricula’s on refreshing their minds and helps them to gain the physical strength and the flexible body. It not only makes the students relaxed it also allows the students who want to enlighten in fields other than studies like music sports etc.QUESTION-1 MOVIE: THE DRAK KNIGHT WHY: The introduction scene of the movie was a bank robbery scene which portraits the nature of the villain in the movie.

88,1,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.No I do not agree with the above statement. Older people do enjoy life as much as young people. In fact in the present day it can be seen that old people are happier than young people. Most of the younger generation these days think that enjoying life means being rich or getting rich. But I feel that it’s not money or other superficial things that make our life enjoyable rather it is love and family that makes life more fun and enjoyable. And for old people family is their life and love. Young couples these days hardly spend time together they are more money driven having no time for love and family. They might superficially enjoy once in a week or a month or a year but that’s not what actual enjoyment means.Older people may not be physically fit enough to enjoy the superficial things but they are fit enough mentally to enjoy the real life. A survey was conducted by the WHO in Singapore in 20012. This involved asking people to what extent they think that they enjoy life. And surprisingly the survey results showed that almost 70 percent of the people who are happy and are enjoying their life are aged above 60. I don’t think it is important that one should be young to enjoy life until unless one stops enjoying life to full extent he/she is young. Age should just be a number only then one can possibly enjoy life till the very end. Of course there are young people who truly enjoy life and they should be the prime example for us to learn the true meaning of enjoyment. The passage makes us see through the view point that professors appearing on TV has benefit to public as well as professors themselves. The lecturer in the lecture has a quite opposite opinion. According to the lecturer when a professor appears on TV his/her reputation among the professors group is decreased because they feel the professor is rather entertaining than educating. Whereas in the passage it was said that appearing on TV makes professors acquire reputations in their academic fields among much wider audience than they have in university.According to the passage when a professor appears on TV thousands of people outside the narrow academic community become aware of the professor’s ideas. Contrary to this the lecturer points that when professors appear on television their availability for students of university is decreased this leads to decrease of the professor’s importance in the university. This may lead to situation where that professor is not invited for conferences or may not even get help for his research.The passage points out that when professors appear on TV the reputation of their universities is increased. People start to think highly of those universities which leads to increase in donations and application from potential students.To the end the passage points out that TV programs are usually superficial and are not deep and thoughtful but when a professor appears on TV to share his ideas viewers get a taste of real expertise and insight. On the contrary the lecturer says that TV broadcasting channels are not concerned with the depth of topics but are more interested in overview which can be presented even by a reporter who has done his homework.

88,2,"The idea of altruism is fantastically explained in the passage.The lecture highlighted about the behaviour of meerkats that contradicts the information given in the passage.In the passage it was said that a guarding meerkat goes without food while others eat whilst accordig to the lecture the guarding meerkats are the ones that eat ahead of other meerkats.Another point where the lecture contradicts passage is- It was given in the passage that when a guarding meerkat issues an alarmit sholud flee alone but the survey mentioned in the lecture tells us that the guarding meerkats go into the burrows immediately after issuing alarmwhile putting the rest of the group in greater danger.Coming to humans altruism is not very common but there are cases of such behaviour in everyone's life.For example when a person donates an organ(like kidney as mentioned in the lecture) to a relative it depicts the altruistic nature of that person.But the lecture questions us that even for such altruism there's a non-material reward like increased self value.The term 'Freedom' is one of the important things in our life.In my opinion the situation where adults live with their families for longer is better.One shouldn't misunderstand 'freedom' as 'staying away from family or '.It's is really important for a young adult to understand these two things. You can enjpy the freedom even while you saty with your family but that kind of freedom isn't guarenteed if you choose to be independent.When we live with our familly it guides you in every aspect of life say it education or career development or anything family always stay by our side and guides us to the goal.There was a survey in USA where it was assesed whether adults staying independent of their family or the ones with their family were more successful.To surprise it was found that most of them prefered to stay indepndent but the ones who were with their families were far more successful than others.Infact it was found that the later category enjoyed a greater range of freedom than the prior ones.From the viewpoint of families it's important to stay together parents help their younger ones to overcome the obstacles that were experienced by them.Staying with family is like staying with a guide for life which teaches us and makes us learn the lessons of life effectively.And more importantly in our younger adult age most of are tempted to choose the wrong path in life and ruin the this wonderful gift we get. The possibility of such error is greatly reduced when we stay with our family.At the same time we need our space that's true! So parents should also be considerate about our freedom. Staying independent of family may give us that space but it doesn't give us the right freedominfact that's shouldn't be called freedom.So I would like to conclude by saying asking that ""Do we really need to be independent of our parents or family? after all they are make our life right?"""

89,1,QUESTION 1:A great introduction is similar to a great opening scene in a movie. List two movies that you have seen and then give the reason why that opening was so memorable for each of them.MOVIE TITLE: MagadheeraWHY: The opening scene of the motion picture is wonderful due to the immense mood melodies and titles giving a number tallying from the saint and the scene begins with outstanding mountain view and all of a sudden the on-screen character dropping out from the mountain. And for her a legend will bounce off from the mountain is what makes the audience puzzled at the first scene. The sound effects and the picture effects which were added behind the scenes were so splendid. MOVIE TITLE: Beauty and the BeastWHY: It is a traditional fairy tale which begins with a narrator describing the story of a young price who lived in a shining castle and how he transformed into a hideous beast. Later it zooms out from the castle and then we see the title then fades up on the home of Belle who is an important character in this movie. With its strong characters and lively story telling its introduction is really a great opening scene in movie. Essay 1: If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?The place which I may take it off anywhere within the world is ‘Maldives’. If your idea of paradise is a lovely sand beach with palm trees in between then Maldives the perfect place to go. I have never been there but I would love to go there one day. It is one of the blessed lands in the world that has so many things to show to its visitors. Many countries have tourist attractions which are very much similar to one other. But this country is somewhat unique of all countries. This tiny country has extremely lovely sandy beaches nice resorts sky diving within the blue ocean waters. It’s a heaven for those who are looking for sky diving. There is also a large alternative of water sports for the travellers like windsurfing sailing boat beach volleyball. We can find beautiful resorts offering many facilities and also there are some resorts which resemble like villas having an outstanding glass door view of the ocean water. The natural land scape of Maldives is also very much attractive. Even for ladies there are many outlets which contain domestically made handicrafts. Maldives main attraction is that the ocean and it may be referred as treasure hoarded wealth of marine life you can find a numerous fish and plant species under water. The picture perfect clear seas have to be seen and the first underwater eating house is additionally situated in Maldives. That is why I would pick up Maldives to go if I would have given a chance to go anywhere in the world.Essay 2: The school board is considering implementing a longer school day. Some teachers are against it because it will affect sport practices. Other teachers are for it because students need to be better prepared for high education after high school and a longer school day means more time to learn for the students. In an essay to be read by the school board write why the school day should or should not be longer.THINK AGAIN!! About the discussion for implementing a longer school day I oppose it because the students also need to concentrate equally on sport practices and other extracurricular activities. They also need to spend some time with their families. Students are already too bored to walk in to school keeping them for longer hours is no longer productive. In fact some student may get really exhausted spending their whole day in school.Even teachers will get tired each day. Students need to spend more time on their home works that means teachers equally need to spend more time on their on their paper works and they even need to spend some time with their families and for their personal stuff. They do need to rest and relax. Now if the school hours are extended at the end most of them will be stressful. The good alternative for this can be providing students good and efficient teaching by good teachers so that students can be better prepared for higher education. There are some safety concerns also. Students need to go home during day light only. Some students walk home from school and if the school day is extended kids will be walking home without any safety or security especially for girl students. So the school board need to think again before extending to longer hours
89,10,Professors are normally found in classrooms offices universities but sometimes they are also found on television news programs as guests. These television appearances do not bring a great benefit to them. In fact being a TV celebrity is a great disadvantage to them. They waste their precious time by rehearsing what to speak and concentrate on dressing up to look good in the TV program rather than doing research meeting students and concentrating on the university business. They spend more of their time in the studio not on campus. Moreover professors who keep on entertaining this way do not have the potential in real life and not called for important meeting which requires the well. They may not have good reputation in real life as they are not so serious about the academics or organization in which they are working. Even public who watch these TV program are also not much benefited. Because the lectures given by professors in TV programs do not include any detailed explanation about the topic. Only a brief historical introduction and academic title is discussed. They don’t gain much knowledge on the subject by just watching it. The background of the topic is not discussed in such TV programs.

9,2,Q1. What does Randy mean when he says “We cannot change the cards we are dealt just how we play the hand?”Ans Randy’s dad always taught him when there’s an elephant in the room introduce them. If you look at the CAT scans there are approximately ten tumors in his liver and the doctors told me three to six months of good health left. That was a month ago so you can do the math. I have some of the best doctors in the world.So that is what it is. We can’t change it and we just have to decide how we’re going to respond to that. We cannot change the cards we are dealt just how we play the hand.Never underestimate the importance of fun.  Choose to have fun.  Have fun while learning something hard.  Randy says “I don’t know how to not have fun.  I’m dying and I’m having fun.  And I’m going to keep having fun every day I have left because there’s no other way to play it.”Q2. What was the essence of the talk the key points covered in the talk?Ans: Randy talk is not about death though.  It’s about life and how to live.  Specifically it’s about achieving childhood dreams and about how you can try to achieve them.  Randy Pausch talks about his dreams enabling the dreams of others and what lets you get to achieve your dreams.Key points: -1. Have specific dreams. 2.Brick walls are there for a reason. 3.Be good at something.4.When you don’t get what you want you get experience.5.It’s all about the fundamentals.6.You can have your cake and eat it too.7.Get somebody to be reflective.8.Work and play well with others.9.Apologize properly.10.Never give up. Do the right thing.

How many (his) childhood dreams did Randy talk about?Ans: Randy talks about below 6 dreams. Dream 1: Zero Gravity Dream 2: National Football LeagueDream 3: World Book EncyclopaediaDream 4: Captain KirkDream 5: Winning Stuffed AnimalsDream 6: Being an ImagineerQ4. What did Randy say about being specific regarding dreams?Ans:- Have specific dreams.Randy didn’t want to be an astronaut he wanted the floating.  When he got older he found a way to experience zero-gravity without having to first become an astronaut. When you don’t get what you want you get experience.Randy says it so well “Experience is what you get when you didn’t get what you wanted.”Q5. What is the importance of brick walls?Ans: - Brick walls are there for a reason: They let us prove how badly we want things.  Brick walls let us show our dedication.  “They are there to separate us from the people who don’t really want to achieve their childhood dreams.Q6. What did Randy learn while pursuing to fulfil his second dream- that of playing in the National Football League?Ans: - Most of what we learn we learn indirectly (or by “head fake”):Randy teaches us that we actually don’t want our kids to learn football … but we send our kids out to learn much more important things: teamwork sportsmanship perseverance.  “These kind of head fake learnings are absolutely important and you should keep your eye out for them because they are everywhere.”Q7. Why did Randy say that “I am very glad that football has been a part of my life?”Ans: Randy says that because it’s just one of those things where you know if I’m working a hard problem people will see me wandering the halls with one of these things and that’s just because when you do something young enough and you train for it it just becomes a part of you and I’m very glad that football was a part of my life.Q8. Was Randy sad that he was not able to play for NFL? Why?Ans: - No Randy was not sad when he was not able to play NFL because he said if I didn’t get the dream of playing in the NFL that’s okay. I probably got stuff more valuable because looking at what’s going on in the NFL I’m not sure those guys are doing so great right now.And so one of the expressions I learned at Electronic Arts which I love which pertains to this is “Experience is what you get when you didn’t get what you wanted.”Q9. How does Randy accomplish his dream of writing for the encyclopaedia?Ans: When Randy was a kid he had the World Book Encyclopaedia on the shelf. For the freshmen this is paper. We used to have these things called books. And after Randy had become somewhat of an authority on virtual reality but not like a really important one– so Randy was at the level of people the World Book would badger– they called Randy up and he wrote an article and this is Caitlin Kelleher. And there’s an article if you go to your local library where they still have copies of the “World Book.” look under “V” for virtual reality and there it is.Q10. Which quality did Randy learn from the character of Captain Kirk?Ans: - Leadership: -clearly there is this skill set called leadership no doubt that there was a lot to be learned about how to lead people by watching this guy in action (captain Krik) and he just had the coolest damn toys. Randy means oh god he you know– Randy just thought it was fascinating as a kid that he had this thing and he could talk to the ship with it.Q11. What important message did Randy convey through his dream of winning stuffed animals?Ans: - Find the best in everybody no matter how you have to wait for them to show it. “You might have to wait a long time sometimes years but People will show you their good side.  Just keep waiting no matter how long it takes.  No one is all evil.  Everybody has a good side.  Just keep waiting it will come out.”First come first serve.Q12. What inspired Randy to become an imaginer?Ans: When Randy was a kid he was eight years old and their family took a trip cross-country to see Disneyland and if you’ve ever seen the movie National Lampoon’s Vacation it was a lot like that. It was a quest.And these are real vintage photographs and where Randy in front of the castle and– and for those of you who are into foreshadowing this is the Alice ride. And he just thought this was just the coolest environment he had ever been in and instead of saying “Gee he wants to experience this” he said “I want to make stuff like this. “that make randy to become an imaginerQ13. Explain: Wait long enough and people will surprise and impress you.Ans: - Find the best in everybody.Find the best in everybody no matter how you have to wait for them to show it. “You might have to wait a long time sometimes years but People will show you their good side.  Just keep waiting no matter how long it takes.  No one is all evil.  Everybody has a good side.  Just keep waiting it will come out.”. Q14. How important is the communication style while trying to say the same thing?Ans: Get a feedback loop and listen to it.When people give you feedback cherish it and use it.  “It can be a spreadsheet of data or it can be one great person that tells you what you need to hear.  The hard part is listening to it.”Show gratitude.“Please” and “Thank you” go a long way. It’s not what you say but how you say it.Randy shares an example where two people say the same thing but they say it in different ways: “I don’t know” is different than “Well I don’t have much information but one of my star faculty members is here and he’s all excited so I want to learn more.”Q15. How did Randy enable others to fulfill their childhood dreams?Ans: - If you lead your life the right way your dreams will come to you.“It’s not about how to achieve your dreams but how to lead your life.  If you lead your life the right way the Karma will take care of itself.  The dreams will come to you.”
9,3,Writing Task 1:Altruism is an unselfishness behaviour among animals which means sacrificing for other animals and gaining nothing for themselves.Sharing of food and donation of human body organs are the examples for Altruism.Animals sacrifice food and even their life in order to assist their member group and best example among them is Meerkat.When Meerkats move in groups for hunting food an individual Meerkat acts as a Sentinel to protect them from the predators.Whenever a Sentinel Meerkat sees predators it starts alarming thus alerting other Meerkat groups to run away or seek shelter.By standing guard Meerkat makes its life more risk to a predator.Thus altruistic behaviour makes the survival of other animal groups.Writing Task-2Now-days most of the people are willing to have nuclear families which make the younger generations to impart the same from their parents. Independence is required in every case of an individual but that should limit to some extent. So according to me it is best for the young adult to be as a part of his or her family for the following reasons. Firstly a young adult will be under the supervision of his/her parents so that there will be no deviation of his mind on to the negative things which will make his career ruin. For Example if a teenager comes out of his family he will soon get addicted to the posh immaterial things and if he is not in a position to earn for himself he then starts earning in a wrong way which means that losing his own character for stupid things. Secondly living with parents for a longer time makes a young adult to build his/her morals of life and finally tuning himself/herself into a good individual to his/her family and also to the society. For example when there is a bad situation in one’s family the head of the family takes responsibility in handling the situation and tries to figure out the least possible case to come out of it and to lead as usual life .This is a case that makes a teenager learn from his parents on handling these kind of situations and try build his character. In conclusion a teenager should have enough thinking levels on what he is expecting and should go on with his family relationship for a longer time to prove himself a great characterized person.
9,4,Task-1:Professors who appear on TV do not fall into a category of professional stand which means that they are not serious Scholars.In addition to this they only fall into an entertainment category as per the lecture is concerned.On the contrast professors benefit from appearing on TV because they get much publicity which in turn increases the University Standards as if the reputed person is from the specific university and this result in increase of donations for an university.On the other hand the professor is given much importance because of the following reasons: 1) takes lot of time for rehearsals before giving a lecture on TV. 2) Time spent on His appearance .3) Explaining doubts and meeting Students.Next to this when professors get reputed then one of the major problems faced by them will be that they do not come to university campus and usually appear more on TV. But this may be helpful to other students outside the university but not to the students within the campus levels. Finally the above are few points that oppose the given paragraph. Task-2:Topic: Young people enjoy life more than older people do.Generally young people have more options and many choices for their enjoyment as old people do not. But in my opinion I equally support for young people and also to older people because of the following reasons:Firstly not only in this trending environment but also when take the past generations young people enjoy at most times as if there are not given any responsibilities as that of the older people have. For Example young people like teenagers go to college just by doing their work that is assigned by their teachers where as the older people have may responsibilities like cooking looking after their younger ones for all needs helping them whenever they are in need and many things to go on.Secondly young people make some adventures and they do not care for anything as if they have no responsibilities. They sometime go out for tours with their school mates and college mates and have lots of free time to do their work whereas the older ones always care for their children and do not risk their life for making adventures.On the other hand older people also enjoy their life by spending time with the people of same age and in addition to this they even plan tours along with their families to long distances which makes a strong bonding with in their relationships. Next to it few of the older people also enjoy their life in attending spiritual classes and also listen to all such related topics which usually come in Television channels .Also they plan for some pilgrim centres with same age groups and that makes them even happier when they get bored of the routine life.In a nut shell there are equal options for the young ones and also for the older ones to enjoy one own life at the extreme.

90,4,"SOFT SKILLSWRITING:1)In this lecture we had the topic named ""Altruism"" .Altruism is the a behaviour which generally observed in humans and it is rarely observed in animals. In the audio lecture we had heard about the meerkats behaviour. From this we can observe the mode altruism is the a rare behaviour which is opposite to selfish behaviour.Altruism is observed in humans when we meet a unknown stranger like by offering food saying information required and guiding or help for any reason and some of the humans donate their organs and necessities with of any greediness. This sought of behaviour is called altruism.Author also mentions about sentinel meerkats who stand for the group and observes the predators and makes an alarm signal to the groups to escape without having any food and shelter all the time and many sentinel meerkats lost their life for sake of their groups and families .Sentinel meerkat : it goes without food while others eat and it places itself in grave danger After it issues an alarm it has to flee alonewhich might take it more risk to a predator since animals in grouos are often able to work together to fend off a predator.2)From the moment a person born struggle for the independence and fight for the independence For example in the childhood at the age of months and years baby tries to escape from the parents and struggles for standing and support and likely to move independently without any support.As of now coming to adults adults has more observing mind power than compared to childhood and have certain thinking abilities over a situation. Not all the adults are of same kind some can’t live without parents as they are potentially strong.Some adults need an independence from their parents to have an independent life whreas some persons won’t prefer that. Their independence depends on certain conditions .if they met their conditions then the decision will be onside. Up to certain age every person should be under the control of the guardians or parents For example a child of ten years cries for an unwanted thing parents must take care and keenly manage the situation and gift them with a thing useful for them .Most parents does the same.Independence is needed to every individual after the maturity age or else after completing the studies or when he enters into the profession.If the adults who are not enough lnowledge about the people around him isn’t allowed to leave independently as of he isn’t having enough knowledge.By this we can say that if an adult strives for the independence from the parents the decision took by the parents should be useful for him and for them."

90,8,Everyone in the world wants to enjoy in their life as much as possible. Every individual has its own way of enjoying the life. In general young people have more chances of enjoyment than that of older people. This is mostly due to the reason older people have lesser life time when compared with younger ones.As Young people have more energy they can do things easily that is not possible for older people. The zeal and the huge energy in the young people makes them more enjoy than that of older people. As younger people have less health issues when compared to the older ones which makes time for them to enjoy more. Some sports like tracking racing and other challenging games can be easily performed by youngsters than compared to older. Older people cannot take part in these kinds of enjoyment due to risk to health. As a result due to more chances of enjoyment younger tend to enjoy life more than older people. Moreover as teenagers have more opportunities of doing things they like to do whenever and whatever this makes their life more enjoyable. The young energy helps them in achieving the success in all the tasks they like to do and they can build their professional career easily. But an older person who has passed the desired age-limit will be not be eligible for the same opportunity due to his age. As more opportunities are available for young people they enjoy their life more.Anyways even older people enjoy their life but in their own way. Having gone through all the experiences and the situations of life usually older generation desire for relaxation peaceful and a slow-paced life. They usually enjoy being at home with their family. In modern world tech enjoyment involving speed and attention does give up their reality real nature enjoyment. By spending time with their family gives them most enjoyment.But the diversity of enjoyable things gives young people more chances to enjoy life compared to older people.
90,9,The lecture in the listening section and the passage in the reading section talks about the university professors and their appearances in public. The reading section conveys that the professors’ appearance is useful for both public and university. The lecture contradicts the information that is present in reading section. The reading states that the professors themselves get benefited by appearing on television as they gain reputation to a larger scale among the general public. The lecture however states that such appearances were not good for the development of professional careersNext the reading passage makes the point that universities can gain and benefit from these appearances as well and the universities will gain the reputation by those professors which will increase the market of the university in the public. The lecture ignores it by saying that the professor is wasting his time by spending in television instead he could spend time with students or by doing research will works fine for him.In conclusion the reading conveys that the public can learn from these television shows of professors and that they can gain the ability to understand things that they never knew about before or taught before. On the other hand the lecture concludes this argument by saying that the television shows do not invite professors to talk about the deep knowledge they have as this was not their aim. They invite them to talk about the general issues and their main aim is to attract the public by the title of the professor and not by his knowledge or designation.
91,1,Altruism is actually a behavior of sacrificing its own things to others. According to the passage animals sacrifices things to others .for example meerkats the individual acts as sentinel standing guard and looking out for predators where other in hunt for food and some other to obtain food. By standing guard the sentinel meerkat don’t get anything. It goes without food while the others eat and places itself in danger And humans are also helpful to others. Even if they don’t know other person they are helpful to others starting from the small things like sharing food to big helps like donating body organs etc.. According to the audio humans and species both are altruistic .Species helps to other species and human are also. Humans donate kidneys even though they don’t the other person . Now a days some of the adults like to live with their parents and some other want independence.According to me the opinion depends on the mentality of that person. Living with the parents is better because that is the age where most of the people may take wrong step and do wrong things. If we go in a wrong way parents are there to explain us about things which are wrong wrong . In todays generation adults are doing wrong things (not all the youngsters but some)eventhough Parents are taking more intrest towards their children.They are habituated to ciggerattes and drinks . For example in nirbaya case the people who did the thing are from worst background and they all are of rowdies type. If those people are under the guidance of their parents they may didn’t do that things.Because parents will observe the every step of their child and they protect their child. The main thing isnow a days children are staying in hostels from 10-15 years age only.They are habituated to that and are not willing to stay with their parents that is the main reason .and one more thing is forgein culture .Following forgein culture is became a fashion for todays generation people.That is not good all the time.We should know every thing but have to do the write thingsthat is possible only if when parents and children will live together. Parents don’t know what their children are doing until parents and children will live together .So they can know what their children doing And stop them from wrong things. Writing TaskPassage mentioned positive points on professors giving lectures in TV. It is clear that audio was quite opposite to that view.As a coin has two sides Every things leads to positive and negative. Passage mentioned positive impacts on college college students and professors and the people . And Audio mentioned negative impact on the college students and on the college. According to Passage By TV shows college and professors reputation will increase and also people who was watching TV also will get knowledge on that particular topic.As journals and news paper articles by the professors are maximum read by only other professors and not all the people professors will get more response on TV shows rather than publishing their journals or any other newspaper content. And By seeing a professor with a highly knowledge people will have high expectations to that college. So that the college and professors reputation increases.But according to the audio It can have negative impact on the college and college students. Because of TV shows professor’s time might become waste. (Show time preparation time travelling time etc..).So he/she may spent on that things in college hours. That is may loss to the students and college reputation.

92,9,"1Altruism is considered to be an act of mere kindness or opposite to selfishness. Altruism is more commonly found in the clan of animal kinds rather than humans.According to the lecture the recent surveys show that animals which act as Sentinels of their group enjoy more facilities like eating food before the othe rmembers of the group etc.Well apparently it has been proven that sentinel guard which sees the predators first gives out an alarming cry to alert the other members of the group. This infact helps the predator to focus on the group rather than one since the alarming cry by the sentinel makes the group to either gather at a point or move away towards the safety. This gives the sentinel more chances of saving his life.Even though Sentinels are brave enough to do such risky tasks it has to be ensured that they attain the importance of their valuable deeds.Similarly when compared with the altruistic nature of humans it doesn't depend upon the amount of the work done or the importance of deed it all depends upon the unselfish nature of the society to act altruistic similar to the meerkat.""INDEPENDENCE FROM FAMILY DOESN'T MAKE YOU STRONG IT MAKES YOU FEEL NOSTALGIC""Firstly it all depends on the attitude of the people living with their parents. Eventhough we consider ourselves to be a westernising/modernising country it isn't necessary to leave the parents and leave an independent life. The culture of Nuclear families is gaining popularity in our country because of ennumerate reasons depending on the class people belong to in the society. Enthusiastic youth tend to leave their parents as young adults to pursue their passion in the form of career. But they do forget the fact that their parents always care for them.Leaving your parents as a tender youth is a complete misconception among the people living in the present society. Nevertheless there arises a question did they leave you when you were young?! Most of the cases it's absolutely 'No'. Prominent celebrities like Virat Kohli started oldage homes to ensure the protection and service of the old who are left stranded by their children.Actually staying with parents for a longer period of time makes one happy and feel secured. They get the feeling of surity while discussing personal as well as social grievances with the close ones like parents.Afterall sanity is the only thing one requires."

93,2,As the generations are changing the mentality of the people is also gaining a drastic change. Now- a- days most of the young generation want to be more independent by standing on their own capability in this world. The youth want to be independent and want to gain the knowledge about the society with their own interest. They want to get away from their parents exploring the world all by themselves. This is a right way to get self capable and also to improve the self confidence. They will understand the world better by being independent rather than being with their parents as they may have viewed it in a different manner. However being away from parents may lead to certain loss as values and morals but they can be capable of making new relationships. Moreover they can understand the depth of the relationship concept by being away from their parents love. Every day they learn new things. The youth who prefer to be with the parents may not get a chance to view world better because they have influence of their parents on their mind and their way of thinking. By being independent they can have a lot more interaction with the social communities rather being with the parents. However being away from family is also not good leaving their parents alone but to gain more knowledge one should see the world in his own perspective. Hence in my view being independent is more useful to the youth to get into a new world and can have a freedom to understand and explore the things by their own and developing their capabilities.
93,3,The lecture and the passage was about professors on television. In the passage it is given that it is of great benefit to the professors as well as the universities and also to the general public. In contrast in the lecture it is said that it is not at all benefit to any one and it is of time waste. In the passage it is given that by appearing on television could acquire reputations among a much wider audience which also enhances professors as scholars. But in the lecture it is said that it is not a professional standard. By being on television no one will become a scholar. In the passage it is given that the universities will also benefit when the professors appear on television they think that when a expert professor appear on Television the people who are seeing will think high about that university. On the other hand in the lecture it is mentioned that the main goal of a professor should be to educate the students. At last in the passage it is mentioned that public will gain from the professors being on the television as they don’t have direct contacts with any of the professor but in this way they can learn from experts but in contrast in the lecture it is said that the academic title is not intellectual substance.
93,4,The Little Match GirlOnce upon a time there was a cute little girl who was of seven years of age who was homeless. She lost her parents when she was of age 5. She is staying in an orphanage nearby the City Park. The caretaker of that orphanage was of bad attitude she used to treat children as slaves and they used to get food only if they bring some money after selling the Match sticks they have made. It was sometime in December the little girl was selling the matchsticks she brought with her. She was hungry and her mouth waters seeing food around her. She tried hard and still there are some matchsticks left in her basket. It was late at night moreover it was December there is full of snow falling and it was too cold. She stopped selling her matchsticks and headed back to the Orphanage. She was walking along the roadside and she saw a happy family sitting together and having their dinner. She felt bad and she was upset she felt like crying by reminiscing on how things have changed. The weather was too cold that the little girl can’t bear. She saw a place with a roof and sat there.As it was too cold she wants to use a Matchstick to feel the warm but she is left with only six matchsticks. She is in confusion to do or not to do but last she decided to use one. Then she used the first Matchstick from the six sticks and felt the warmth of the fire and felt like she was near the fireplace but the stick put off after burning. Again she used another stick and this time she saw her mother calling her. Then the same happened the stick was blown off. She don’t want to miss her mother and then she used her third and fourth stick which showed her mother asking her to eat the dinner and playing with her. Then to continue that she used fifth and sixth stick together and felt like her mother took her into her arms and making her sleep.Now the six sticks are over but the girl neither woke up nor felt the cold it is not because that she was in her dream of her mother. A death has occurred there at that midnight of the little girl who let her soul reach her mother’s after life.
93,5,The young people enjoy life more than the older people do Yes i completely agree with the statement. The younger people have a lot chance to enjoy the life as they at the begin their life at that certain age whereas the older people would have seen all that in their young age too and have become experienced. The young people will have a lot of energy to go out and explore the world while the older people are not. The young generation can go and explore the total world. They have an enthusiasm about their life wanting to know what is going to happen next in their life. The young people learn new things from their mistakes and they start to understand the complexities of the life and learn how to get out the problems and because of this they will get experienced. As i have mentioned earlier the old people also have crossed this young age and have got a lot of experience about the life. The young generation wants to be independent and learn the things. They learn to share and help each other. They choose their own way of living. Not all the young chooses the right path but who chooses will become a good person in his future life. The young generation work hard. They challenge every single aspect of their life. They struggle to reach the goal and finally succeed in doing so. The life of the youngsters will be more adventurous they try to do new adventures in their life some can be fun and some can be life changing. Thus i finally conclude that the life of the youngsters will be fun with lots of adventures and experiences but to some constant it may lead to problems so the older people experience will be more useful to the youngsters to choose the right path in their life.
93,6,Question 1:Movie Introduction:Movie – the entertainment part in the busy schedule of people. So many people work hard to deliver a quality film to the audience. Every movie will be unique by its story. The main heart of the Movie is Story (content). Next will be the director producer choreography music and all the other departments. The world's oldest desert in Namibia; A solitary railway line & A royal family on a royal journey. Mr.A (Hrithik Roshan)sky-dives and lands on a train that is carrying the Queen. He steals her crown by disguising himself as the Queen beats her guards easily and escapes. This Movie broke several box office records mainly those for opening day and opening weekend grosses.Radha Mohan and Krishna Veni are a couple leading a miserable marital life due to several misunderstandings and decide to apply for divorce. They die on 14 February 1983 at 10:20 AM near a clock tower on their way to the lawyer's office. This film broke the previous records and the members of the same family that is Akkeneni family has worked in this film and created a new record. A movie which has a good storyline will always break the records. In the first film Dhoom 2 it has a mind blowing introduction. It’s all about the technology the hero uses to enter the train and also for escaping .It’s like a superhero thing .And the second film Manam is a family entertainer this introduction shows how a small misunderstanding between the couple can lead the life to. Question 2:Favourite Vacation place:Paris the capital of France is one of the most beautiful and popular cities in the world. Allen Ginsberg once said “You can't escape the past in Paris and yet what's so wonderful about it is that the past and present intermingle so intangibly that it doesn't seem to burden.” Paris was established over 2000 years ago and is therefore a very rich city in terms of history and culture. Paris is the place where fashion culture and music are fabricated together and of course where 'love' will live forever. Paris usually known as “the city of love”. Some people also say that Paris is the city of light probably because it has amazing scenery during the night. There are wonderful restaurants and food. Elegant restaurants and casual sidewalk cafes lie throughout the city. This beautiful city is also the fashion capital of the world. Paris is a fantastic city that holds the key to your heart. There are wonderful places to be visited in Paris such as Eifel tower Disney Land Palace of Versailles etc. This is the place where i always dream of going. Paris has a reputation as the “City of Art”. Paris has attracted artists from around the world arriving in the city to educate themselves and to seek inspiration from its artistic resources and galleries. Paris is recognized globally for its public landmarks and masterpieces of architecture including the and a symbol of France the .Question 3:Longer school days:“Should the school day be longer??” No. The school day should not be extended as it can affect the children not only physically but also psychologically. Some may think that by increasing school timing may help students to improve in their education but it is not going to happen. Some may think that the students get more time for learning. If the teaching methods in the used currently aren’t working then how can spending more time using those same methods can change anything. Quality time is better than quantity of time spent. The more the students spend in school the less time they will have outside of school. This the time they spend time on the extracurricular activities such as art music karate etc. Children already spend a large portion of their day being told what to do how to do it and what rules to follow and have little free time as it is. The ability to make their own decisions on how to spend their time is a learning experience too. Hence i think extending the school day will not help the students to improve in their studies. Schools have to deliver a quality education to the students so that they can improve. The extracurricular activities also help students to develop the concentration on the subject. If the students are mentally healthy then they can also be physically healthy. Don’t steal the art that is inside a student by making him sit in the school.

94,1,The passage says Altruism is a type of behaviour in which an animal scarifies its own interest for that of another animal but when come to reality it is the duty of that individual to must do because it have gain the benefit or services of other.In every group to be safe from predators one should take care of the attack from predators so it is the duty of everyone to do. When one is in the position to safeguard there is no need of another so there is only a chance for one to do the job which we call it as Altruism .Here who is acting as altruistic doesn't gain anything but it the duty to do to have safety for their group.
94,2,In the passage he says that if professors give a programme in the T.V there are many mutual benefits like universities get reputations and broadcast networks benefits by getting TRP ratings and also to the public by watching it. However here in the lecture she opposed it by saying that a professor cannot explain all the all the mater regarding to the lecture or topic he want to explain.Here the broadcasting networks make money by wasting the time of the professor by not giving him much time to explain what he wants to. Because no one like to listen the long lecture given by him. They would waste the time of the professor in the studio so that the students who need help would not get it.In the studio he can only covers the topic names but not the content in the subject says in the lecture but in the passage he said people get benefited by watching those lecture this is how the lecture is opposing the passage.Young people enjoy life more than older people doEnjoyment is the thing that which keeps you happy there may be different types of enjoyments in those some may like some kind of enjoyments and some people like some other. Some enjoyments liked by one may not like by others so I cannot say young people enjoy life more than older people do.Young people like and enjoy the bike riding and also the races but not the old people however still there are some old people who enjoy it who are exceptional.Old people like to read a newspaper early in the morning with a cup of tea and enjoy it a lot rather than sleeping to the late morning.However there are some commonalities in the both young and old people where they both enjoy like having some chat in the evenings with family.Some people enjoy planting trees and some people enjoy by cutting them down and making money some like adopting animals and some like selling their skins. Some enjoy by donating money to poor some enjoy taking money from the people illegally. So enjoyment does not stick to the age it depends on the personality how he thinks or how odd he thinks. So there are many kinds of enjoyments and which are enjoyed by different kinds of people but not the different ages of people. Enjoyment is in every work so that everyone can enjoy regardless of age.

94,5,Why should managers and software engineers pay attention to the costs involved in software development documentation? It is difficult to store the number of files about the documentation because they are large in number. A high proportion of software process costs is incurred in producing this documentation. Documentation errors and omissions can lead to errors by end-users and consequent system failures with their associated costs and disruption.What are the types of documents that may be required during the development process of software? They are:1. They should act as a communication medium between members of the development team. 2. They should be a system information repository to be used by maintenance engineers. 3. They should provide information for management to help them plan budget and schedule the software development process. 4. Some of the documents should tell users how to use and administer the system.What type of documents goes into process documentation? 1. Plans estimates and schedules: These are documents produced by managers which are used to predict and to control the software process. 2. Reports: These are documents which report how resources were used during the process of development. 3. Standards : Set out how the process is to be implemented. 4. Working papers: Record the ideas and thoughts of the engineers working. 5. Memos and electronic mail messages: These record the details of everyday communications between managers and development engineers.Why does process documentation become outdated frequently? Progress will normally be reported weekly .This process information is of little use and no need to preserve it after the system has been delivered. But some process documents can be useful as the software evolves. What is the role of working papers in software development? These are often the principal technical communication documents in a project. They record the ideas and thoughts of the engineers working on the project are interim versions of product documentation describe implementation strategies and set out problems which have been identified. They often implicitly record the rationale for design decisions.

95,10,Hemanth ThotaIH201685095Writing TaskTask-IThe reading passage gives a positive feedback about professors appearing on TV according to the passage a professor giving lecture on TV has many advantages to University professor as well as general public who watches the TV. But the lecture opposes the reading passage and gives the following disadvantages about a professor giving lecture on TV they are as follows When a professor appears on TV he is wasting a lot of time at the TV studious instead he can spend his valuable time in research or giving lectures to his students.Students at the university are in need of the professor’s lectures where there is no need for public to listen to his lecture.Universities may find difficulties when a professor is not available for students.The lecture given by a professor can be done by the journalist if he does some hard work.But the reading passage gives the following advantages when a professor giving lecture in TV they are as followsProfessors acquire reputation as authorities and fame in societyProfessor can get wider audience Universities can have positive publicity when their professors come in TelevisionPublic gains knowledge from professors.These are the points from stated from the lecture and reading passage.Task-IIThe phrase Enjoying Life is quite a common word we use it in our daily life but when it comes to implementation there are lot of variations about how a man can enjoy his life. When it comes to enjoying in different periods of your life it is controversial. According to my view people at any age can enjoy their life but it depends on their personal parameters young people have time to plan their day where as older people have various responsibilities. Since young people have time they can spend their time in their hobbies partying and other stuff where they can find fun. Young people have good control over their health which enhances their efficiency which turns out to be a active person where older people should take care of their health and look after their children this creates the major difference between young and old people. Young people have a very few or little stress out of their mind which makes them live more stress free which in turn leads to enjoyment than people at greater age who has more stress. On the other side there is a wide counter talk that older people can enjoy more a young man can do. This is because of many reasons stated below. Young people are in state or in their way to achieve something in life if they concentrate more on enjoying rather than their career it main spoil his/her life but a older man is ready to enjoy as he as all set with his career. It’s the responsibility of the young people to satisfy their parents teachers and should achieve something in that case it is the older generation who has no tensions and can live life peacefully So it is always controversial to judge who can enjoy more.

96,1,We generally see the professors in the college. In addition to that we may see them in office library news papers and also in telivision. Sometimes these television appearences have benifits for professor Universities and also public.The passage is regarding reasons why professors appear on teelevision. for reputation of the professor and college and to educate the public.But the passage also says about disadvantages As some professors regularly appear in the TV they may not it much seriously. And also the time of the professor will be wasted interms of giving lecture and making it ready (reharsal ).We are not sure that because of this the professor is getting benifited or not. Because there is a chance of getting neggetive impression for the professor.Because of the above reasons it is highly questionable whether professors ap-pearing on TV has any advantage. In fact it could bring negative consequence both to the professors themselves and the universities they teach.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We can say that Young people enjoy life. But we cannot compare young people and old people in enjoyment. According to me the enjoment would be with respect to the person not the age. If we are not happy even if it is young or old does not matter.However sometimes we can say young people enjoys a lot because they have the energy to do so. For Example If we discuss related to sports both young and old can watch a football match. But young people enjoy more by playing like the players where as old people doesn't have that much stamina to play. In addition to that young people can travel more distance than old people Because as we said old people have less energy. For example If we want to go for the world tour young people can travel more and cover many places compared to old people. Finally there is no kind of differentiating between old people and young people It all depends on there own enjoyment.

Academically too we can see drastic changes in improved in the grades of the students. But this is the time to concentrate only one aspect for few days. Because we are running out of time for the exams So maybe it is better to put aside the sports till the completion of the examinations so that the improvement in the results increases much more.

96,9,"Oh!!! It's really very interesting. I really don't worry about the adults who wants independence from their parents as soon as possible. I am a complete family boy as off I know about me. According to me you will be more safe if you are in a family compared to living out without a family.Sharing some feelings with family members is great relaxation and you will have that much confidence that you can you anything. facing difficulties being alone suffers more compared to sharing the problem among all family members is differs. We live in a house where there would be 23 members in my family. If anyone face any problem in the house more times the problem being solved by the family members itself.And my brother who is seriously concern about the family has scarified his love for the family. He was In the situation like either you have to go with your family or go with your girl. But my family is very much ready to accept the girl in to the family (As I mentioned earlier problem would solved by all) but the family of the girl was regretted. finally they broke-up and started new life with their spouses and families happily.So my humble request is ""Stay Happy - With Family""Altruism is exactly opposite to the selfishness. They get nothing from what they have rather they will find themselves in danger sometimes.They willing to sacrifice food sometimes even their life life too. As author said Meerkat acts as a sentinel trying to save others from the predators.It will show the braveness and kindness of the Meerkat In the world if everyone behaves like this then there wouldn't be any conflicts with anyone. rather the unity would be outstanding. Here we can say that being a Altruistic it is often referred to the great human. we can so many things from the story that importance of the Altruism makes every one's eyes open. So here we want to say that there may be some extend of Altruism in human but it is ranging in boundaries. It would be great pleasure to be in that list of Altruism.As long as you live try to help others in any manner in which you can do. So that by watching you someone may help some other one.One Thing we can say here ""Work Hard...... Help Others!!!"""
97,1,I am glad that I got this opportunity to share my love for my dad. This time I am not going to write to fill the page or to get marks but to express my thoughts honestly. My dad has influenced me the most in my life. He is my role model. I seriously tried to follow his footsteps till now. He is the one who always makes me happy in any situation and struggles to do so. He is a government teacher by profession and a poet by his choice. If I have listened to his every word I might have been more successful.It is better to use word “inspirational” than “influential” for my father. He motivates me every time I feel nervous or tensed. He always encourages me and never disappoints me even in tough situations. I am moving forward with the strength he gives me. Without him I cannot survive in this world. I hope he will always be with me and influences me in the rest of my life.From: Date: 02/01/2017To: Subject: New idea for company’s growthGood morning sirI Likhitha am one of your employees working as a game developer in your company. It is my pleasure to work here in this most famous organization. I would like to be part of the development of this company. So I am writing you to put forward my new idea to be used in the upcoming project. Idea: Gaming and animation are excellent entertainment sources for kids. So if we develop the next project with 3D effects and sensor moves there will be growth in our market. To implement this idea I would like to have a technical team with 4 members.Java developers to improve effect of gaming activity.Senior in gaming software to develop graphics in 3D.Technician to add sensor activities.It would be glad if you think about this once and accept my idea. Hope this idea brings statistical growth in our market. I will be eagerly waiting for your response.Thanking you sirRegardsV.Likhitha. Favourite introductory scenesEvery one of us might have heard of a famous phrase “Don’t judge a book by it’s cover.” The idiom says that one cannot judge anything without going through it totally. But in some situations especially in movies and special programs first look and curtain raisers like teasers trailers have much effect on audience. Sometimes these become the deciding factors of movies to get hit or flop. I heard somewhere that “Every journey starts with a good step.” This totally applies in case of movie making. The opening scene of a movie can change the essence of the entire movie. The first scene of a movie drags the attention of audience and creates more interest. I would like to explain the most memorable opening scenes I have seen in movies. SHIVAY: I recently watched the movie “Shivay” and the first scene of the movie was awesome. The leading actor Ajay Devgan was a Himalayan mountaineer in the movie. The opening scene was a sad moment and it created suspense and curiosity in every one. Then the next scene starts with flash back. In the next scene he climbed the Everest very easily and intensity of that scene was so nice. His acting was very natural. Everyone will like that scene. In fact the movie was little boring and the story line was too short. But scenes like this created interest in us. This definitely helps the movie to get good talk.HARRY POTTER: Another movie I like most is Harry potter movie series in which the opening scenes are very interesting and mysterious in all the parts.So these are the movie scenes I liked and can say that a great introduction makes any thing much better.Opinion on implementing longer school dayIf I am one of the teachers of a school board and need to give suggestion about the proposal of implementing a longer school day I will stand against it. These days’ kids are already facing many problems because of our education system and it affects their future. Our education system needs to change a lot.I would suggest not to implement longer school day as it will affect their sport practices. Children have to play sports and games daily to develop physically and mentally. They want some refreshment from studies which they do the whole day.If the school day is extended again for some more time they will lose interest and get bored instead of spending more time on studies. Then there will be no use of implementing the idea of longer school day.Teachers can see better results if this time is allocated to practice more sports and for fun activities among students than planning to implement the time for more studies.So my opinion is not to implement the idea of extending the school day for studies and I would try to convince the members of the school board to change their idea in this way.
97,10,To: Raj8@gmail.comSubject: Performance appraisalHello raj I have been going through your performance and project records from a while. You are one of the good employees among us and happy to be working with you as a team. Also the deployment of project has done really well. As a team-mate I would like to give my assessment for your performance and hope you take it positively. First of all I want to let you know about your poor team skills. You are a good co-worker and polite towards other team-mates. But this kind of behaviour alone is not sufficient for producing good results. You really need to improve your team skills a lot for a good collaborative work in a team. It will be very helpful for your team if you learn this. Another point I would like to mention is that you should improve presentation skills which I heard from or clients. This might have negative effect on your career unless you improve your skills. The main thing I did not mention yet is your lack of assertiveness. This may become a big barrier for development of your career. Assertiveness is a key aspect in any work environment. So I want to suggest you improve this too. I believe that you take my assessment in sportive way and will work on them. I will look forward for your response on my feedback about your performance.Thanks & Regards_____________________V.LikhithaXxxx technical solutions pvt ltdHyderabadPhone:xxxxxxxxxLikhithav22@gmail.com.

97,15,Dream vacation destinationSince my childhood I always loved to go for world tour as I like travelling. Travelling was one of interests. I still feel the same today. Travelling brings joy and excitement in our lives which we lost in this mechanical world. It boosts our energy to get back to our regular life again with great refreshment if we take some break and go on a trip to some place. I always wanted to do this but have not yet done it.If I could go anywhere in the world I would visit Venice Italy. This wonderful city is built on islands and has no roads just canals.This is a unique city which is not only famous for its scenery but also for its creativity in construction. I have read somewhere that the city is also a symbol of wise government and freedom.I also seen some pictures of the city-Venice in which the building structure was impressive which creates enthusiasm to visit this place. The city is built entirely on water. It clearly reflects the great nature of the place. This attracts the people easily.So I would like to travel to Italy (Venice) and visit as many islands as I can visit. And I will go there and will make my wish come true.
97,16,Young people enjoy life more than older people do –Yes I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are many reasons to support this statement. Every one of us definitely have lot of experiences in our life to think of the meaning behind this statement. This bring a different energy in us.Usually young people are known to be careless reckless and not serious about their lives. People think that they just enjoy life and do not think about any thing else. But actually to say this kind of thinking is wrong. Young people have ore knowledge about our society and surroundings than older people. Older people only think of their generation and do not understand the circumstances and problems of younger people from their end. This leads to conflicts between the two generations. Only few parents understand the situations of their children from their aspect.So I can definitely say that young people enjoy more because they do not have any responsibilities financial problems family problems and any other hard situations. Even though some younger ones have such kind of problems they can face them bravely and move forward in their lives.And the main reason that older people can not enjoy life as much as young people do is that they will become exhausted weighing all the responsibilities being parents guardians of their family members. And one more thing is that their age has already been gone to enjoy life any more.The basic and most important reason behind the statement given is that STUDENT life is the most lovable time in every one’s dairy to enjoy their life. This is the main cause that affect our life enormously from all corners. Being a student can enjoy life in peaks than any other person can do who may be an older one or younger.
97,2,TV Professors vs University ProfessorsFrom to the lecture being television professors is not much advantageous. From the passage it was clear that University professors may get fame and reputation if they appear in TV. Only few professors get chance to appear in TV and a few utilise their chance.Along with the benefits of being not only a University professor but also TV professor there are some disadvantages too according to the lecture. The main disadvantages are:University professors are not much invited as television professors as university professors are different from TV professors. Because TV professors are known for not only for bringing awareness among people from their lectures but also they entertain the viewers. This can not be done by the University professors as not that entertaining. So the job as a TV professor does not suits them.Professors being TV profesors may not be invited for some good scholastic meetings and programs as they do not appear serious when appear in television.Another disadvantage is that University professors mostly need to do research and give lectures to their students.Also professors who appear in television hardly have time to prepare materials and other required documents necessary for research. And they could not complete even the basic needed works in their personal life because of working for extra hours.

97,7,Character: An alien from outer space.a college studentSettingnear a Foresta college libraryTimelate at nightSituation/ChallengeA secret needs to be confessed to someone elseSECRET--(Don’t guess just read)I hope this is the right chance to spill the beans. I have been waiting for this. I really have an interesting secret needs to be confessed to someone else but could not do it as no one believes it for sure. This is my secret.It was my first day as a college student and everything was nice there. As I am a book lover I visited our college library and went through almost all genres. There I found a book about an alien from outer space and stopped there. From the next day I started to read that book daily for some time without fail. I totally addicted to the stories on aliens and read all facts about them. I was becoming curious day by day and decided to find the truth about aliens in real.One fine day late at night I went to a place about which I have read in the books to look for any clues. The place was near a forest which is 40KM from my home and need to cross that forest to reach that spot. I was scared to go into forest alone first but mustered my courage and continued my journey. I almost reached the other end of the forest then suddenly there was a big noise and a very bright light that I couldn’t even open my eyes .After few seconds I tried to open my eyes and got astonished at the next moment.I found a group of some strange creatures in a big spaceship when the spaceship was about to start. In a flash the spaceship disappeared with those aliens. I was literally fainted and fortunately reached home safely at last. It took nearly a month to come out of that shock but I have finally got some satisfaction and felt proud of myself. So this is my story.Now comes the real secret. The greatest secret that I never thought is I have such a good friends who love me a lot but sorry to say so dumb and blindly listen to whatever I say without any sense. You should have guessed it a prank at least by reading about me as a book lover as you know that I’m not but I am glad to have friends like you. Keep smiling….

97,9,Passage 1: ALTRUISMAltruism is a kind of behaviour which is quite opposite of selfishness. The animal which is best example for altruism quality is Meerkat. From passage meerkats are mammals that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa. They look for predators standing like a guard and acts as sentinels.But from the lecturethe important point is that the standing guard in Meerkat eat more and stands as sentinel with full of stomach while the others hunt food when one Meerkat acts as a sentinel. And anothe thing about Meerkats is that they are naturally generous. One Meerkat is to be taken as a sentinel and it should protect other Meerkats.And these mammals performing altrustic acts gain nothing according to the passage. The lecture is about altrustic acts of Meerkats says that the Meerkats which acts as a sentinel gain respect and other profits from their group. They concentrate on predators which may approach their group and do harmso they give a signal to their members and issues alarm.So this sentinel behaviour of altruistic acts helps the survival of whole group of Meerkat mammals.2.SITUATIONS:YOUNG ADULTS WANT INDEPENDENCE AND SOME WANT TO LIVE WITH PARENTSI support both situations as they depend on the mentality and mindset of the members of a family. Young adults may want freedom from parents but it is wrong saying that it is independence from their parents. As an independent individual every young person should develop his/her life skills.Depending on parents their whole life is a disgusting thing.The other situation is that some young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer timethat is their kind hearted nature to care for their parents.On the other hand some young people want to stay with their parents just to spend the earnings of their parents and spends life unless working hard.This is very opposing thing that those young people should mature their minds.That is why I prefer people's character and not situations.So the situations given depends not only on young ones but also on parents. But in normal case in my opinion being independent is an good thing. So i prefer first situation of getting independence from parents .It does not mean that leaving parents for ever and don not show caring for them .If we get independence we can achieve our goals by our own and make our parents feel proud. If they forget their parents after they got settled and left parents with out any concern is a bad thing that i do not support ever. But when young adults want to get independence as soon as possible is not a bad thing. Every thing in this world is connected to other situations and all are inter connected. One can not judge other person with out having any idea.So i feel that the first situation is better one and that does not mean that the second situation is bad.It may seem to be in a diplomatic way but according to me the situations are depended and interconnected.

98,11,Q)  If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world where would you go and why?A) If I want to go on vacation anywhere in the world I wish to choose VATICAN CITY the city with low population and with low pollution. The total area of that city is approximately 44 hectares with population of 842. More than half of the city is covered with gardens which provide ecofriendly to nature. The city observes a variety of climatic conditions so that we can feel pleasant and comfortable. Buildings such as St. peter`s basilica and the Sistine Chapel are home to some of the most famous art in the world which includes works by artists such as Botticelli Bernini and Michelangelo. The Vatican Library and the collections of the Vatican Museums are of the highest historical scientific and cultural importance. In 1984 the Vatican was added by UNESCO to the List of World Heritage Sites; it is the only one to consist of an entire country.Schools days should be longer or shorter is a controvencial concept. According to the school board the view of increasing amount of hours may lead to the more education for the students. But it is not real in the holistic perceptive. The view of school board is to increase the gradesbut unknowingly the converse of this may happen as per many reports which was stated by National school Boards for public education which states : “Decrease in time would be for the best interest of education”. In our modern world of education the average student ranging from all grades and ages go through a school day of 7-8 hrs. Although these hours are thought to be such a short period of time they are the major cause for high stress within teens as well as loss of value education and sleep which may lead to deterioration of education. “Today`s children are tomorrow`s citizens” can be achieved through only effortless and value based education but not with a regressive approach of learning.
98,12,Writing based on Reading and listeningThe key points made in lecture are:Whether any one being beneficed?Missing invitations for university academics?Lack of money for research?Waste of time?As it is mentioned in the passage that the universities students professors and society are benefited from the guest appearance of professor in TV. But it is fact that no one is going to be benefited from that.Because when any professor goes for TV appearance it will be a main problem for both universities and students. For the university management it is difficult to maintain extra staff and for students it results in lack of explanation process.When any professor goes for a TV appearance there will be more chances for him to miss the invitations to give any journals. But in passage it is mentioned that “professors are important as scholar is enhanced.When any professor goes as TV guest lecturer he /she may miss money to perform any research as the university is going to sponsor for the lectures those are available in university. This ends for lecturer in investing own money for research.It will be waste of time as lecturer has to come from another place. This results in waste of travelling time preparation time and others.These are the key points that are discussed in lecture.
98,13,Young people enjoy life more than old people do?Every person`s life is divided into four major categories. They are:Childhood Teenage(young age)Middle ageOld age In every category each individual has some limitations. In childhood limitations are being kept by parents and in middle age we ourselves keep limitations for our children`s sake. The remaining two periods are left to our decisions and our choices. During young age we think there is no one who will stop us but during old age there will be no one to stand with us.The most important and precious part in everyone`s life is teenage (young age). We will eat the fruit in future from the tree that we planted in young age. In my point of view young people enjoy life more than old people do. Because during young age everyone will think only for their sake and there will be no limits for them. I believe that “Today`s old people are also young people in past of their life and also they enjoyed their life”. At certain period these young people will become old and they cannot enjoy at that time.So we should enjoy when we are young. There will be a large number of ways for young people to enjoy but for the old the enjoyment lies in seeing their grandchildren. Some will enjoy by playing games and sports. Some will enjoy by watching movies and going to several places. But we cannot say that young people have to enjoy all the time. There should be some limit for the enjoyment also. The young people should plan or make their way so perfectly to have a bright future along with enjoyment. For example if we consider a family grandparents will not enjoy as much as their grandchild enjoys. So I agree that young people enjoy life more than old people do and I want to add one more point that the output of enjoyment must be a good one.
98,14,MOVIE TITLE: GENTLEMAN (2016)WHY: The introduction scene of this movie is the best introduction scene I had ever seen. This movie begins with a scenario in which the two heroines are sitting side by side in a flight. After some time they introduce themselves to one another and they describe their love story to each other. The director raises curiosity in viewers by visualizing the same person as their lover. The rest of the story deals with how they settled in their respective fields. MOVIE TITLE: Ashiqui 2Why: In Telugu there is a saying that “mana kopame mana satruvu”. I found this through the entire movie. The movie starts with the introduction of hero with a theme song which describes the character of hero and his attitude. The introduction scene also explains how the name and fame will degrade individual`s character.
98,15,Meerkats eating habits is mentioned in the lecture. The sentinel meerkat stands guard near the burrows. The meerkats eat before the standing guard. The standing guard may have full stomach.Recent studies gave a very better example for understanding altruism among both humans and animals. There are some people who donate their kidney to other. It doesnot gain increase in sense for him or it doesnot earn fame for himThe people in the society may be of different types. If we consider the young people in society most of them feels free to live away from their parents and wants to live as they wish. This helps them to develop their individuality.The individuals those who live away from their parents may get success in their life but they don’t achieve complete goal of their life. As a child of them every youngster has some responsibilities to do for their family and for their parents.There are many great personalities who stayed along with their parents even after their success. For example Abraham Lincoln the first president of America used to stay along with his father in their paddy fields in order to help him.For every individual teenage is more precious and important in their life and it also acts like a turning point in their life. If the individual stays away from their parents there will be more chances for him to destroy or to change his mind set. Because when he stays away from his parents he thinks that he can do anything which he wants to do. This leads him to a chance for addicting to bad habits.In other case we will find some adults who stay along with their parents for a long time. The reason behind was they want to do something for their parents by helping them and staying along with them in times of need.It is not true that all the adults who stay away from their family/parents needed to be addicted to bad habits. There will be also more chances to find youngsters who addicted to bad habits even if they stay along with their parents.Whether we live away/along with parents it’s only our character which decides our ability individuality.I think any of the situations is better and it becomes more fruitful when we are capable of maintaining/controlling our mind within our limits.

99,1,AltruismThe passage is all about the behaviour of animal or group of animals. Here the content describes how the animal sacrifices its own interest for the other one or group. The people who perform Altruistic acts gain nothing for themselves. One apted opposite meaning for Altruism was Selfishness.Some of the examples of altruism was mostly seen in humans and among other mammals. The Unselfish acts among humans range from the sharing of food with strangers donations of blood and even organs to family members and others too. These acts are altruistic that they benefit another yet provide little reward to the performing one.In fact many of the species perform Altruistic behaviour like sacrificing food or even their life for the other members.The meerkat is the one of the example of altruismwhich is a mammal that lives in burrows in grassland area of Africa.In a group of meerkatsan individual acts as head or leader or sentinelstanding guard and looking out for predators while the others hunt for food or eat food they have obtained.If the sentinel meerkat sees some one approaching the group it gives alarm by cry to alert other meerkat to escape/flew.By standing guardthe head meerkat gains nothing-it goes without food and their is much risk to the life even though it safeguards for other meerkats survival. Independence the word it self’s describes the FREEDOM. These days many of the young adults preferred to be independent but until and unless we have the ability to live independent we can but not in all cases. In most cases the person who lives far from parents will undergo drastic change in is life style. Most of them will addict to bad activites.Even if we are far for education we must be under the control of given freedom. In this 21st century the western culture had more impact on us as a result most of the young adults preferring to be independent in the name of freedom.From my personal experience i have faced much independence as i was out of home for the sake of education and i have came across many of the people with different mentalities and came out of home and faced many difficulties to fulfil their necessities. In some case we learn how to be with and in community and how to face the hard times. But my opinion is to be familyeven after we stand financial good.Although their will be some disturbances every families but for that reason we should not prefer independence. In tuff times you will come to know how the family will support you. The advices which they give are most from their experience and good character you built in will be under their guidance only. Here we will learn how to handle the situation.My opinion is to be with family in this century in all families they were giving freedom.If there were restrictions they were to safeguard us
99,2,PRACTICE TEST-2.WRITINGTask.2: “Young people enjoy life more than older people do”. As we grow older and older we may struck with all the responsibilities these reflects to make life bound.

99,7,Listening and Note taking: As I understood to concentrate on a lecture listening to it while taking note helps us to remember the topic for longer time. To get the fullest information from the lecture the suggested tips are very useful. The process is divided into three parts as before during and after. Before: We should make sure what was the topic of the lecture is going to be and read it once if we have any doubts note down and take them along. Check where you have got to how you got there where you will go next. The notes may available on some Edu website or power point handouts available on lecturer website take print out lecture notes and use them as reference notes.During: We should not completely rely on lecturer’s notes or in friends because by writing our own notes we will improve our understanding this note taking should include the title and date of lecture in order to review it easily. And should not miss the beginning of lecture because it reviews previous lectures or outlines objectives and lecture structure. We should leave plenty of empty space in the margins so that we can easily add extra points to it. We may not able to note entire lecture but we should make simple note as if we can refer it for many other times use different colour pens to understand notes clearly make relevant examples. Don’t leave the class early the lecturer may repeat the points again. After: Reviewing of notes after the lecture may help to remember the topics for long time.Recopying notes for several times to make notes neater is the waste of time.Discussing notes with friends will help us to remember lecture for long time.
